We know.-

- Human. DNA It's like a huge note.I don't know.

- Some of them.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,EncodingIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Protein But actually... **98% Yes.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Non-coded areaIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.**98% Yes.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Non-coded areaIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea. These areas are responsible for controlling when the genes are.In what cells?I don't know.

- The functions of these areas are unpredictable A small mutation could have a major impact on health.Like some cancers or rare diseases.I'm sorry, I don't know.

AlphaGenome It's a new type. AI Model It's meant to be more accurate.Full-scale prediction of individual DNA Effects of variability on genetic regulation processes Pay particular attention to non-coded areasPossession of the genome98%I'm not sure what I'm talking about.Control function for theI don't know.
**It's more accurate to reveal the function of these non-coded areas and their performance in different cells. And the possible consequences of variability.I don't know.**It's more accurate to reveal the function of these non-coded areas and their performance in different cells.

- Could a mutation cause an accidental activation of a cancer gene?

- Which one of the clipping points could be damaged. It leads to genes.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Wrong spell.What's the matter with you?

- Which sequence is appropriate?‚ÄúAt the end of the day,CustomIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Use it in the nerve cells.

Compared to previous models AlphaGenome Yes. DNA Sequence LengthSignificant breakthroughs in predictive resolution and modeling capabilitiesI don't know.It builds a unified framework. It can be used to study genetic expression.CutProtein combination site, etc.I don't know.

## What can it do?
AlphaGenome Yeah.-

### ‚úÖ 1. Inputs are too long DNA Sequence

- Analytic **‚ô™ Long ‚ô™100Ten thousand bases.DNALetterI'm not sure what I'm talking about.**‚ô™ Long ‚ô™100Ten thousand bases.DNALetterI'm not sure what I'm talking about. Sequence of the ‚Äî‚Äî It's a lot farther than the old model.More comprehensiveI don't know.

### ‚úÖ 2. Projection of thousands of regulatory properties
Including-

- Which locations could be gene start or end point?;

- Which regions will participate RNA CutImportant biological processes);

- Which ones? DNA The region is attractive to certain proteins.;

- In different cell types RNA Activeness of expressionI don't know.

### ‚úÖ 3. Rapid assessment of the impacts of variability

- Compare sequence predictions before and after mutation;

- To be able to tell that this mutation may not cause illness.To influence genetic expression or disrupt the regulatory functionI don't know.

### ‚úÖ 4. Overwrite cut mutation predictions

- It's an important breakthrough. Especially in understanding. **A rare genetic disease.**A rare genetic disease. It's very useful. Like spinal muscle atrophy.I don't know.

## Practical application scene
AlphaGenome It's not just a theoretical tool. It has a very strong application value.-

### üî¨ 1. Research on disease mechanisms

- It can be used to reveal which mutations affect genetic expression. This could lead to cancer or rare genetic diseases.I don't know.

- Official presentation-Forecasted T-ALL Certain mutations in leukemia are activated. TAL1 Cancer gene. Simulation of known mechanismsI don't know.

### üß´ 2. Synthetic biology

- Help design specific functions DNA ShapesLike a starter that only starts in a nerve cell.I'm sorry, I don't know.

### üß† 3. Gene function mapping

- Assist scientists in systematically mapping genetic control mechanisms in different cellsI don't know.

## Why is it a breakthrough?
It's solved a number of key constraints.-
![](https://assets-v2.circle.so/9jncqcluw5uuxrvcp2zjawyeit10)AlphaGenome Yes. 24 Among the projected missions 22 A model that goes beyond the current best model. It's also prominent in mutation predictions.I don't know.

## Limitations and future developments
Despite the progress made, But... AlphaGenome No, it's not.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Almighty.@Ambassin: #Jan25 #Jan25 #Jan25

- üå± Complex FormLike the environment or multigenesis.I'm not sure what I'm talking about.Still need to be analysed in conjunction with other toolsI don't know.

The future. DeepMind Plans to expand training dataSupport more species and functional models And gradually open up the whole model.I don't know.
