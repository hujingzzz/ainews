Google officially released **Search Live**, a brand-new ** voice search experience model**. **Search Live** integrates the capabilities of the Geneini technology and the traditional search engine so that you can interact with the search engine like a conversation.

# Core functions include:

- A natural, fluid voice conversation with GoogleSearch**;

- It can be used seamlessly in multitasking contexts, such as moving, packing and household chores;

- Support for continuous follow-up on a question-to-answer basis;

- Presenting links to relevant web pages** for further browsing;

[https://assets-v2.circle.so/77qt7jogrlw97j8aqfwy71gdqei] ##  How does it work in reality? **  When packing bags **: “How do I get a linen dress to be unwrinkled?”  AI direct voice response with a web link. ** ** ** “What's the quickest way to do now that I have tomatoes and eggs in the fridge?”  On the way to the kitchen, I can also read the recipe page. ** ** ** On the way to the car ** “What's going on in Chicago today?”  Can you get advice without a phone?

##The functions that go on to support Google plan to further upgrade the Seech Live mode in the coming months, adding ** Visual recognition**:  Users can “show” what they see by the camera, and Google will respond by combining voice input with visual images. This will bring the search experience into the “multimodel interaction” phase, not just your question, AI's answer, but ** “You say + you see, AI understands”**.

Open Google App; click on the new **Live icon**; ask direct questions, such as: “How to prevent the frewment of the frenzy in the travel box?”; receive an AI audio response (continuing question: “What if it wrinkles?”); view the text or continue typing questions; and look back at the dialogue in the “AI Mode History”;

# Back technology: Gemini+Search integration # # Gemini based voice generation model

- Understanding the context and generating high-quality voice responses;

- A natural language fluidity and logical integrity of the answer;

Search engine system supports the source of information

- All responses based on Google search databases and web ecology;

- Provision of information links** that are genuinely accessible** and not limited to the subjective expression of AI only;

“Query Fan-out” technology

- Generate multiple query directions for one question and provide a richer web content result;

- Users not only get answers but also “expand awareness”;

# The meaning of user experience and industry # # search from keywords # real-time dialogue **

-Search is no longer an ice-cold query box, but a "accompanied assistant experience";

- AI can respond and make recommendations in a more complex and vague context.

** Lower threshold for access to information**

- Fits for busy situations in which equipment cannot be operated by hand;

- Reduced user reliance on keyword tectonic techniques and more natural interaction with search systems.

** The assurance of the credibility of the information**

- Unlike some purely AI chat systems, Search Live continues to rely on web resources to provide clear and verifiable sources;

- To achieve a mixed interactive experience of the Generated AI+ Real Network.
