Yes. Google I/O 2025 Let's go.Google DeepMindIt's the first time it's made public the cutting-edge technology that it's developing. ‚Äî‚Äî **Gemini Diffusion**Gemini Diffusion It's a whole new way of applying diffusion models to language modelling.I don't know.

## What is it? Gemini Diffusion

- Traditional language modelsLike GPTI'm not sure what I'm talking about.Adoption**Self-ReturnautoregressiveI'm not sure what I'm talking about.Mechanisms**Self-ReturnautoregressiveI'm not sure what I'm talking about.Mechanisms Generate one at a time tokenI don't know.

- **Gemini Diffusion**Gemini Diffusion From the image generation field‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Proliferation modelsIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Mechanisms‚Äî‚ÄîGenerate the full output by gradually de-noise.I don't know.

This kind of non-cause.non-causalI'm not sure what I'm talking about.The method of reasoning brings with it two major advantages.-
**It's amazing how fast it's being generated.**It's amazing how fast it's being generated.-Koda! **2000 token/sec**2000 token/sec Including tokenizationPrefillAll computational processes such as filteringI don't know.
**More global reasoning.**More global reasoning.-Do not rely on step-by-step production Can think of the whole thing.I don't know.

### Modeling principles
üÜö Distinction from traditional self-regression models

- **Self-regression models**Self-regression modelsLike GPTPaLM Wait.:
Predict the next word sequentiallytokenThis is the first time I've ever seen you.One after the other.I don't know.

- Advantages-It's a simple structure.Wider applicationI don't know.

- Disadvantages-Generate slowGlobal coherence limitedI don't know.

**Gemini Diffusion Model**Gemini Diffusion ModelProliferation-based mechanisms:

- Core idea-**Step-by-step from random noises‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Go on, go on.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Generate text**Step-by-step from random noises‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Go on, go on.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Generate text Similar to image diffusion modelsLike Stable DiffusionI'm sorry, I don't know.

- Each step is not a direct generation of words. It's about fine-tuning and correcting the content that is currently being generated.I don't know.

- It's faster to build content. and can correct errors in the process of generationerror correctionI'm sorry, I don't know.

### Main advantages

- Working methods-I'll take one first.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Full text expressionIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Add noise damage And then the training model step by step.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Go on, go on.I'm not sure what I'm going to do.Restore to Reasonable TextI don't know.
Advantages-
**Allow whole generation**Allow whole generation-You can start with a broad draft. And then it's changed over and over again.;

- **Natural support for error correction and editing**Natural support for error correction and editing-Because, in essence, every step is there.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,AdjustmentsIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Contents;

- **Fits for complex structure generation**Fits for complex structure generation-It's like math.Programming Language Requires structural and semantic rigourI don't know.

**üß© Natural mechanisms for correcting errors**üß© Natural mechanisms for correcting errors

- Errors in traditional model generation require external tool detection and rewritingI don't know.

- The proliferation regime itself includes a step-by-step process of amendment Makes the output more fluid.AccurateI don't know.

üßÆ Mathematical and code-processing skills

- Gemini Diffusion Yes.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Verifiable structural contentIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.He's doing well.I don't know.

- For example...-Math ExpressionProgram Code Need to satisfy syntax correctness and logical consistency Proliferation models are better at this.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Edit Generation

## Case Presentation

### 1. **The programming scene was excellent.**The programming scene was excellent.
Gemini Diffusion Specially good at code generation. Brendan It's called...‚ÄúAt the end of the day,**vibe coding**vibe codingIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Experience-It's almost a real-time high-quality code.I don't know.
Actual velocity reached. **2000 tokens/sec**2000 tokens/sec That's the speed involved.-

- tokenization

- PrefillprefillI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- Security Filter

- Output Synthesis

üëâ Contrast GPT-4/Claude Waiting for self-regression models The speed increase is remarkable. Fits for high-frequency interactions or low-delayed scenariosLike Code EditorTalking robots, etc.I'm sorry, I don't know.

### 2. **It's easy to solve complex math problems.**It's easy to solve complex math problems.
Traditional language modelsLike GPT-4oI'm not sure what I'm talking about.I'm face-to-face.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Answer first and then answer later.I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.Cross-step logicIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.It's easy to fail in math questions. Because they're predictive. Every step will magnify the previous mistake.I don't know.
Gemini Diffusion Introduction of a non-causal structure Yeah.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,**Construct the logical framework for the complete answer first Fill in the details.**Construct the logical framework for the complete answer first Fill in the details.
üìå Example questions 1-**Title**Title-„Äå(‚àö(81) * (2/3))¬≤ + (15 - 3) / (2¬≤)„ÄçPlease give the answer before the process is deduced.I don't know.**Answer**Answer-39
‚úÖ Gemini Diffusion Correctly completed GPT-4o UnsolvedI don't know.üìπ 

### 3. **Non-linearMultistep reasoning capability**Non-linearMultistep reasoning capability
üìå Example questions 2-**Title**Title-„Äå150 Present. 250 How many prime numbers are there?Quantities of first output All prime numbers are listed again.I don't know.„Äç**Answer**Answer-18 Number of primes List Output As [151, 157, ..., 241, 251]
‚úÖ Gemini Diffusion Accurately completed GPT-4o Same failure.I don't know.üìπ 

### 4. **Non-self-return structures = No more reasoning.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,OrderIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Limits**Non-self-return structures = No more reasoning.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,OrderIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Limits
The non-return characteristics of the proliferation mechanism allow models to**Global optimization of the answer structure**Global optimization of the answer structure To address those needs.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Let's get to the end and start.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Tasks Breaking the tradition. token-by-token LimitsI don't know.

## Application prospects and impacts

### ‚úÖ Apply scene

- High-reliability language generationSuch as financeLawMedical textI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- Programming HelperCode GenerationError fixesI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- A mathematical question solves automatically

- Text EditRhythm.Rewrite Tasks

### üöÄ Technology outlook

- Expectations and Images/Multi-modular diffusion models of voice and so on blend;

- Breaking the existing large language model paradigm Form‚ÄúAt the end of the day,‚ô™ Back to the times ‚ô™It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.A new generation of architecture;
