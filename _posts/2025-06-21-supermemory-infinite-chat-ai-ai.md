Chat RobotLikeChatGPTClaudeWait.I'm not sure what I'm talking about.There's a big limit.â€”â€”They can.â€œAt the end of the day,Remember.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Limited content Because of the context window of the modeltokenLimitsI'm not sure what I'm talking about.There's a ceiling. It's common, like. 8k32kEven... 128k tokensI don't know.
Once it's over this length, Anything you say before will be cut off.Lost As a result-

- Chat Fault Logical incoherence

- User experience drops. Robot response.â€œAt the end of the day,Forgetting.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.

![](https://assets-v2.circle.so/vplpxb7gbqtpxx5l83tpup7139vn)**Supermemory **Supermemory In order to solve this problem,  Launch **Infinite Chat API**Infinite Chat API Context length that expands any modelI don't know.It allows your chatting to work.â€œAt the end of the day,Long-term memory.I'm not sure what I'm going to do.And there's no need to rewrite any application logic.I don't know.
It's a smart agent.proxyI'm not sure what I'm talking about.It's a transparent combination of the existing ones.LLMLarge-language modelI'm not sure what I'm talking about. APIFrontend No need to change the application logic to support super-long dialogueI don't know.

- Claim that it is possible **Savings 90% token and cost**Savings 90% token and cost It also enhances model performance.I don't know.

- It's extremely easy to use.-**Just one line of code to switch.**Just one line of code to switch. Immediately availableI don't know.

- Infinite Chat API â™ª Through the way â™ª **Apply with LLM as a transparent agent between**Apply with LLM as a transparent agent between Only the necessary context for generating a good response is transmitted So that the big model doesn't lose performance over a long period of time in the context.Like20K tokensAboveI'm sorry, I don't know.

- Cost structure-
Start free of charge

- Fixed monthly cost $20

- Every thread. 20k token It's free. After $1/Million token

**It's like a...â€œAt the end of the day,Super-remember hanging.@Ambassin: #Jan25 #Jan25 #Jan25**It's like a...â€œAt the end of the day,Super-remember hanging.@Ambassin: #Jan25 #Jan25 #Jan25

- Auto-managed and compressed dialogue content

- Dynamic extraction of useful old content to supplement context

- There's hardly any delay.

- It saves a lot of money.TokenCost


## What's at its core?â€”â€”Smart Agent + Memory system
Supermemory Byâ€œAt the end of the day,Proxy LayerIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.â™ª The way you're embedded in your existing â™ª OpenAI API Call front Three things.-

### 1. **Transparent AgentTransparent ProxyI'm not sure what I'm talking about.**Transparent AgentTransparent ProxyI'm not sure what I'm talking about.
You asked. OpenAI Interfaces for %1 Now just take it. URL Change it to... Supermemory Address It's going to turn around your request. LLMLarge-language modelThis is the first time I've ever seen you.There are no invasive changes to your business code.I don't know.

### 2. **Smart part and retrievalChunking + Smart RetrievalI'm not sure what I'm talking about.**Smart part and retrievalChunking + Smart RetrievalI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- It talks to the president.â€œAt the end of the day,Split it into pieces.I'm not sure what I'm going to do.And keep these semantics consistent in their home algorithms.

- When it's necessary to continue the conversation It automatically extracts the most relevant contextual fragments from historical records. Instead of sending history with your head in your head.

### 3. **Token Auto-Managing**Token Auto-Managing

- It's intelligently controlled according to context. token Use To prevent the cost from getting out of control.

- To avoid, at the same time, the failure of the request or the interruption of the content of the request

## Actual usage
It's very simple.I don't know.By OpenAI interfaces in %1 for example Just...-
Present. Supermemory Console Get API Key
Take your request. URL Change it to...-https://api.supermemory.ai/v3/https://api.openai.com/v1
Add to the request x-api-key Fill it out. Supermemory API Key
Support multilingual clients Official documentation available TypeScript and Python Example:I don't know.

## Performance and costsâ€”â€”It's practical and not expensive.

### âœ… Performance advantages

- **Infinite Context**Infinite Context-Breaking through. OpenAI Waiting for the model. token Limits Can handle any length of dialogue

- **Cost savings**Cost savings-Because it only extracts useful information. Maximum reduction 70% It's... it's... it's... token Use

- **Almost zero delay.**Almost zero delay.-Forward as Agent Request speed is basically the same.

- **The response is more stable.**The response is more stable.-More accurate context extraction Answers are more relevant

### ðŸ’° Price model

- Amount free of charge-Storage 100,000 tokens No charge required

- Standard plan-$20/Month Enable after exceeding the free amount

- Increment charge-Before each conversation 20k token It's free. Every million after that. tokens Fees $1

## What if something goes wrong?Stability guarantee mechanisms
If... Supermemory It's a self-inflicted mistake.Like failure to retrieve or internal abnormalities.This is the first time I've ever seen you.It won't affect your request.-

- It's going to go around automatically. Send the request directly. LLMLike OpenAII'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- You can still get it. LLM Return result At most, the unoptimised context.

- There's a diagnosis attached to the response. header For example, whether context has been modifiedHow much? tokens Wait. Easy to debug

## Scope of support and compatibility
Supermemory Support all**Compatibility OpenAI API Models and services**Compatibility OpenAI API Models and services including, but not limited to,-

- OpenAI It's... it's... it's... GPT-3.5 / GPT-4 / GPT-4o

- Anthropic It's... it's... it's... Claude 3 Series

- Other provision OpenAI Service provider for interface compatibility layer

And... It's...**It doesn't limit the speed.**It doesn't limit the speed. It'll only be used by you. LLM Limitations on servicesI don't know.

## Let's wrap it up.-
Supermemory Infinite Chat It's a high-compatibility one.No intrusion.â€œAt the end of the day,Dialogue Memory AuxiliaryI'm not sure what I'm going to do.Let's get your chat application out of context. It's cheaper.SmarterSustainableI don't know.
