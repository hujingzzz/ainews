Chat robots (such as ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) have a very limited limitation - they can “remember” limited content because the context window of the model (token limit) is capped, often like 8k, 32k, or even 128k tokens. Once this length is exceeded, what is said is cut off and lost, leading to:

- Chat faults. Logical incoherence.

- User experience is declining. Robot reaction is "forgetting."

** (https://assets-v2.circle.so/vplpxb7gbqtpx5l83tpup7139vn)**In order to solve this problem, **Infinite Chat API** can expand the context length of any model. It allows your chatting to be “long-term memory” without rewriting any application logic.

- claims that ** saves 90% token and costs**, while also enhancing model performance.

- Very simple to use:** just one line of code to switch**, immediately available.

- Infinite Chat API, by acting as a transparent agent between ** application and LLM**, transmits only the necessary context necessary to generate a good response, thus avoiding a decline in the performance of large models over a long period of time in the context (e.g. 20K tokens and above).

- Cost structure: Started free of charge

- A fixed monthly fee of $20.

- 20k token per thread free, after $1 million token

** It's like a supermemory hanger:**

- Automation and compression of dialogue content

- Dynamic extraction of useful old content to supplement context

- There's hardly any delay.

- It saves a lot of Token's expenses.

# What's the core of it? — smart agent + memory system Supermemory embedded in the "agent layer" in front of your current OpenAI API call and did three things:

#1. **The interface you originally requested for OpenAI is now replaced by the URL for Supermemory, which will transit your request to LLM (large-language model), with no invasive changes to your code.

##2. **Intelligent parting and retrieval (Chunking + Smart Retrieval)**

- It'll break down the long dialogue into pieces and keep these synonyms consistent with its home-grown algorithms.

- When it is necessary to continue the dialogue, it automatically extracts the most relevant contextual fragments from historical records, rather than sending the entire history with your head.

#3 **Token Automanager**

- It controls token according to context to prevent the cost from running out of control.

- To avoid, at the same time, the failure of the request or the interruption of the content.

# The actual use is very simple. Take OpenAI interfaces, for example, if: go to Supermory Console to get API Key and replace your request with: https://api.submemory.ai/v3/https://api.openai.com/v1 to add x-api-key to the request, fill in your Supermory API Key to support multi-language clients, and the official files provide examples of TypeScript and Python.

# Performance and cost -- practical and not expensive

# # # # # # # # # performance advantage #

- **Infinite context**: Breaking through token limits in models like OpenAI, which can handle any length of dialogue

- ** Cost savings**: as only useful information can be extracted, the use of up to 70% token can be reduced

- ** Almost zero delay**: transmitted as an agent, with requests largely at the same speed

- ** Respond is more stable**: more accurate context extracts and more relevant responses

# # # price model #

- Free amount: storage 100,000 tokens free of charge

- Standard plan: $20 per month, when the free amount is exceeded

- Increment: $20k token per conversation free of charge and $1 per million tokens thereafter

# What if there's a mistake? The stability guarantee. If Supermemory makes an error of his own (e.g. a failure to retrieve or an internal anomaly), it doesn't affect your request:

- Will automatically bypass and send the request directly to LLM (e.g. OpenAI)

- You can still get LLM's return results, at best in unoptimised context.

- The response is accompanied by a diagnosis, such as whether the context has been modified, how many tokens have been processed, etc., to facilitate debugging

# Support scope and compatibility Supermemory supports all **-compatible OpenAI API models and services**, including but not limited to:

- OpenAI GPT-3.5 / GPT-4 / GPT-4o

Claude 3 series of Anthropic

- Other service providers providing OpenAI interface compatibility layer

Moreover, it** does not in itself limit the rate**, but is restricted only by the LLM service you use.

# Summing up: Supermemory Information Chat is a high-compatible, non-invasive "dialogue memory booster" that allows your chat applications to go beyond context limits, save more money, be smarter, and be sustainable. Experience: Supermory.chat Document: https://docs.submemory.ai/infinite-chat
