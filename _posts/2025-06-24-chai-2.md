Chai-2 The key feature is that Zero sample learningzero-shotI'm not sure what I'm talking about. and High-threshold design A major breakthrough has been made in the field of confrontational design.I don't know.
That is, the model does not require a significant amount of training data input for each new antibody design target.I don't know.It can.â€œAt the end of the day,Start from scratch.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Understand and design new antibodies. Just give me a target protein. It can generate an effective antibody through the knowledge it already has.I don't know.
It uses multimodules to generate structures. Modelling in conjunction with atomic structure predictions and generation Achieved.â€œAt the end of the day,Zero samples.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Antibody designI don't know.Chai-2 But without an iterative experiment, Only two weeks from target setting to molecular generation.Complete process for synthesizing and authenticating And he's got a better hit than that. 15% Exceeding industry standardsI don't know.The results show that molecular engineering is moving from an empirical approach to a manageable one.Nurturing strategy for certaintyI don't know.

## Chai-2 Model

### Model architecture

- **Multi-module full-atom production modelMultimodal All-atom Generative ModelI'm not sure what I'm talking about.**Multi-module full-atom production modelMultimodal All-atom Generative ModelI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- Two core submodules-
Chai-2d: Design submodule For the direct generation of antibody sequences and structures from target proteins and surfacesI don't know.

- Chai-2f: Collapse Module To predict a three-dimensional structure of proteinAssessment of combined qualityI don't know.

**Global Atomic Level Design**Global Atomic Level Design-Not just amino acid sequences. Also consider complementarities between space structures and the atomic stages of the interface.

### ðŸ§¬ Support multiple design formats

- VHHSingle-area antibodiesI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- scFvSingle-chain variable snippetsI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- miniProtein.Small proteins that are not antibodies but that combine the target.I'm not sure what I'm talking about.

## Why are they so successful?
Because... Chai-2-

- **Not just design structures. And predicting effects**Not just design structures. And predicting effects-It's not a guess. It's a three-dimensional simulation and screening.I don't know.

- **It's designed for different types of antibodies.**It's designed for different types of antibodies.-Including common small antibodies.scFv.Camel antibody.VHH.Mini-protein.miniproteinsI'm not sure what I'm talking about.Wait.I don't know.

- **You can control the details.**You can control the details.-You can specify the location of the target.Antibody Styles It can even be designed to work at the same time.**Humans and animals.**Humans and animals.The antibodies.Cross-species designI'm sorry, I don't know.

### Let me give you a few examples.-

### âœ… Cases1-Fight!TNFÎ±A very difficult target.I'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- TNFÎ± Structurally complex Never before.AIIt's been successfully designed for a combination.I don't know.

- Chai-2 Designed antibodies**It's stuck. It's stuck.**It's stuck. It's stuck. For the first time.

### âœ… Cases2-Antibodiesâ€œAt the end of the day,Double VersionIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Design

- For the same target protein.CCL2This is the first time I've ever seen you.Chai-2 Two antibodies were designed separately.scFv and VHHThis is the first time I've ever seen you.The target is in different positions. Outcome**Both of them.**Both of them.

### âœ… Cases3-Trans-species antibodies

- â™ª Scientists let â™ª Chai-2 Designed to combine the same proteins as humans and monkeys.I don't know.

- I did it.-Designed antibodies at the same time.â€œAt the end of the day,Stick it up.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.The target protein for both species.I don't know.

###  What else did they do to ensure antibodies?â€œAt the end of the day,Oh, shit.What's the matter with you?

- âœ… **One-size-fits-all check.**One-size-fits-all check.-Antibodies only stick to the target they should stick to. Don't stick to other proteins.I don't know.

- âœ… **Safety indicators**Safety indicators-AIIt'll assess in advance whether the design is likely to trigger an immune response.ImmunobiosisI'm sorry, I don't know.

- âœ… **Stability assessment**Stability assessment-Vulnerability to variability or congregation It's a matter of medicine.I don't know.
