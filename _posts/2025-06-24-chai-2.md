- Traditional antibodies have found that they rely on animal immunization or large-scale library screening, are inefficient, costly and ineffective for some hard-core targets.

- Existing AI antibody design methods (e.g. RFdiffusion) are generally below 0.1% hit rate (hit rate) and difficult to separate from high flux screening.

Chai Discovery released a new AI model called **Chai-2** to design antibody molecules (** antibody is a drug component used to combat viruses, cancers, etc.) ** which is a special protein commonly used in medicine and biotechnology. Chai-2 is characterized by zero-species learning (zero-shot) and high-level design, which has led to a major breakthrough in the field of antibody design. The model does not require a significant amount of training data input for each new antibody design target. It can “start at zero” to understand and design new antibodies, and by giving a target protein, it can produce an effective antibody through available knowledge.

- ** There is no need for repeated experiments**: the traditional antibody design is wrong, and they can design many effective molecules with one input.

- ** Super-efficient**: It could have taken months or even years to do it, and they could have done it in two weeks** (exceeding 100 times).

- ** Good hit rate**: 50 targets tested and eventually more than 15% of molecules "hit" successfully, already high.

- ** 68% experimental hit rate in Miniprotein design** and picoolar affinity.

- ** AI can do it **: They use a very advanced AI system that doesn't just understand the structure of molecules, but is designed to “think for itself”.

** Application and vision for the future**

- It is expected that a demand-driven **table-specific combination** will facilitate the rapid development of complex therapies such as dual-specific antibodies, antibody drug puppets, etc.

- Support for the design of non-traditional biological drugs such as **cyclopyridium, enzymes, small molecules**, etc.

- Working towards the transformation of biology into “engineering” — moving from empirical discovery to ** controlled, programmable molecular design**.

# Chai-2 model

# # model structure

- ** Multimodular All-Toom General Model**

- Two core sub-modules: Chai-2d: Design sub-module for the direct generation of antibody sequences and structures from target proteins and tabs.

- Chai-2f: Collapse module for predicting the three-dimensional structure of proteins and assessing combined quality.

** Global Atomic Level Design**: Consider not only amino acid sequences, but also complementarities between the space structure and the atomic stages of the interface

# #  supports multiple design formats

- VHH (uni-domain antibodies)

- scFv (single-chain variable fragments)

- Mini protein (non-antibodies but small proteins that combine the target)

## Function bright spots! [https://assets-v2.Circle.so/p1eqau2159i5vg17n3bxtchnz9eu] ## Experimental Results and Evaluations: By one-time input of 50 target marks, Chai-2 generation molecules, with an over 15 per cent success rate, the entire process takes only 2 weeks without an iterative or high flux screening.[] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/5ioicmyvc5g03jebu2h9xnwmij) Chai-2 large-scale laboratory validation in both directions ** antibody design** and **minitete design**.

# # # antibody design mission experimental settings:

- 52 completely new target proteins (no active antibody records)

- Design and test up to 20 antibodies per target (scFv or VHH format)

- Experimental method: Bio-Layer Interferomery (BLI) to determine integration capacity and filiation (KD)

(https://assets-v2.circle.so/973noy1gb5dcasbv27fbonmect9) - **upgrade ** above two orders of magnitude ** compared to traditional antibody generation methods (<0.1% hit rate).

- All designs are validated only through an experimental cycle** and do not require an iterative screening.

# Mini-protein design mission #

- Target number: 5 including PD-L1, IL7Ra, InsulinR, PDFBR beta and TNF alpha.

- Experiment: 20-25 mini proteins per target designed and measured using BLI.

Examples of hits and filiation: [][] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/2dweftoxm87joqagoys6os99iye) - Average hit **> 68%**

- TNF-α is a highly difficult-structured target designed to hit the first successful AI.

Because Chai-2:

- ** Not only design structure, but also predict effects**: it is not a guess, but a combination of three-dimensional structure simulations and screening.

- ** Can design different types of antibodies**: include common small antibodies (scFv), camel antibodies (VHH), miniproteins, etc.

- ** Control details**: The location of the target, the antibody style can be specified, and even the antibody (cross-species design) can be designed for both humans and animals**.

# Let's give a few examples:

Case 1 against TNF-α (a very difficult target)

- TNF-α has a complex structure and has never been successfully designed by AI.

- Chai-2 designed antibody ** successfully glued to it ** and was first achieved!

Case 2: antibody "double version" design

- For the same target protein (CCL2), Chai-2 designed two antibodies (scFv and VHH) in different locations, and both succeeded **!

Case 3: Trans-species antibodies

- Scientists allow Chai-2 to design the same protein that combines humans and monkeys.

- The result was indeed achieved: the antibody capacity was designed to “stuck” the target protein for both species.

# What else do they do to ensure that the antibodies are “reliable”?

-  One-size-fits-all examination**: Antibodies stick only to the target to which they should stick, and not to the proteins.

- **Safety indicators**: AI will assess in advance whether the design is likely to trigger an immuno-response (immunosis).

- **Stability assessment**: Vulnerability to variability or agglomeration is a matter of availability.
