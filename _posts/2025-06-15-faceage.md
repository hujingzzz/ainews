## üîß Detailed study methodology

### 1. **Model construction**Model construction

### 2. **Clinical validation**Clinical validation
Models are validated in three clinical cancer patient data pools.-

- MAASTRONetherlands Ventilatory CentreI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- Harvard ThoracicLung cancer.I'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- Harvard PalliativePatients with terminal cancers Take palliative care.I'm not sure what I'm talking about.
