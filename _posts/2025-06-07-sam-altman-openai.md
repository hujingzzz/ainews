The model was getting bigger. It's getting harder and harder to deploy. Let's just say..._Other OrganiserLet's write a good software to host these models.We're not going to be able to do that."At the same time, We're not going to make a product. It's about wanting someone to build on us. API Build ProductsI don't know.
I can't remember exactly when. Probably. 2020 Year 6 Month We're out. GPT-3 APII don't know.There's no response from the public.
