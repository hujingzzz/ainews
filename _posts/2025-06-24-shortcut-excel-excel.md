**Shortcut** is an AI tool platform designed to automate **Excel's work**. It allows users to tell AI in natural language what they want to do in Excel, and Shortcut automatically completes these form tasks, like an “AI Excel assistant.” It understands what you say, and then helps you do it like an Excel expert, such as:

- Data calculation, aggregation

- A visual.

- Cleaning the data.

- Making charts.

- Formulate.

- Autofill Cells

- Format adjustments, etc.

It solves cases in the Excel and Financial Model World Cup at ten times the speed of the human champion. Shortcut functions almost exactly the same as Excel, you can open existing Excel files to operate or export them, and you can do most of the work with one key, and then come back to see the results.

# Primary function! # [https://assets-v2. Circle. so/3d6kdkdcnj74ko3j6j6mi700x5ambx] ##comparison with traditional Excel usage![] (https://assets-v2. circle. so/ u0gpaurz5thhobj60x62d1zuv39) # Use process 1 to access interface access tryshortcut.ai (which is still being measured and requires an invitation code)  Step 2: import or create new Excel files to upload your own .xlsx files or click on **New File** to create a new blank workbook.  Step 3: enter task instructions in the dialogue box, for example:

- “Statistics of total sales in different countries”

- "Find records of orders above 1000"

- “Transfer all first column text to capital letters”

- “Draw a line chart showing trends in profits”

Step 4: AI automatically executes and updates the table. You will see that the table changes instantaneously, the calculation is complete, the chart is generated,** you do not need to operate any functional bar**.

# Applies to the crowd

- ** Untechnical staff**: No formula, but those who need to process large amounts of data

- ** Finance, sales, operators**: Excel is used daily but tasks are duplicated

- **Liberal & Regulatory **: Desire to save PV operating time

- ** Students and researchers**: tasks such as data analysis, table cleaning, etc.

## Case: Shortcut has been able to complete a full day of professional lawyers in less than 10 minutes, cleaning, editing, and analysing data faster than humans. Not only has it provided quick insight, but it has also created charts and dashboards through an analysis of 5,000 lines of CSV data from all Y Combinator companies. Research shows that most companies are still operating, mainly B2B, but consumer markets are more successful. Shortcut is now able to complete up to 80% of human work on Excel, and its capacity is increasing.[https://assets-v2.circle.so/vlvt1bs0b2a6kbnsapqdzhh7pvs] The case of https://www.tryshortcut.ai/shortcut?file-id=17515193490-yc-companies.xlxsx
