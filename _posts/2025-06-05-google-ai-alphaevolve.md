Google DeepMindIt's a brand-new thing. AI Encoding Agent-AlphaEvolve It can automatically optimize algorithms and make scientific discoveries.

It doesn't just write the code. It also automatically evaluates the performance of these codes. Then adjust the strategy according to the results of the evaluation.Turns out to be a better solution.I don't know.The process is essentially...**Simulateâ€œAt the end of the day,Algorithms evolve naturally.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.**Simulateâ€œAt the end of the day,Algorithms evolve naturally.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.I don't know.

### Where is it?

It's understood that it's a super.â€œAt the end of the day,AIProgrammerI'm not sure what I'm going to do.It can.-

- Automatically write code to solve complex problems;
