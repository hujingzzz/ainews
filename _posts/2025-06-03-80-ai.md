Look at the data up there. I've been thinking about it for the past year.

But then, we heard the programmer always ask for it.“At the end of the day,Dismissed.I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.He's going to be replaced.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Waiting for the point of view.I don't know.

So what's the future of the programmer?
What's the future encoded tool like?
What else can a man do?

## FromAI Coding Forward. AI Development

Hong Dingkun mentioned a real case in his speech.-When the development is complete, They still need to spend a lot of effort on building the environment.Release deploymentbugTrackingWe're going online and we're going to have to do a little bit of work.I don't know.And these non-code parts.

Hong Dingkun identified himself as“At the end of the day,DriverIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.No, it's not.“At the end of the day,Bystander@Ambassin: #Jan25 #Jan25 #Jan25He's going to write. promptTo judge logic.You have to take over the manual at any time.;AI Will the big code that's written eventually land?

One of the things I've said many times in my speech is:_Other OrganiserAI There's a lot to do. But it's still people who drive it.We're not going to be able to do that."
CurrentAIThe encoded tool can write the full code. But it's still hard for ordinary people.

### If... AI It'll complete all the codes. Isn't that something everyone can do?“At the end of the day,ProgrammingWhat's the matter with you?
At first, this question sounds like a technical idealism. But it's actually happening.-

This may be the most worthwhile part of programming in the future.I don't know.
Future development ecology Maybe it'll be re-segregated.
If we look at the next 10 years, AI The following structural changes are likely to result from universal programming:-

## When everyone can program. Where should the programmer go?
