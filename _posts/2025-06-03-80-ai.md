** “** June 11, at the Spring Volcano Engine FORCE Congress, the byte-jumping Technology Vice-President Hong Ding Dynamite revealed the latest user data for the AI IDE tool Trae under the flag: “The overall monthly effort is over 100 thousand and over 80% of the byte engineers are using AI-assisted development.”** ** See the above data, considering that the AI programming tool has been one of the highest technical heat topics in the past year. AI programming tool has entered from the Laboratory's Toys into the Developer's Tool Chain.” Google's CEO Sundar Pichai called: “The productivity of Google Engineers has been increased by about 10% (data is analysed in-house engineering hours). As of this year, more than 30% of the new code has been generated by AI (25% last year) and all AI-generated codes need to be manually reviewed.

#penAI CEO Sam Altman has also publicly stated on several occasions that: “Our first reasoning model is about one million in the top line of the Global Programmer Competition. O1 (September 2024) ranking = 9800 O3 (December 2024) rankings = 175 now, based on our internal assessment, our internal model is now 50th, and it is expected to be first this year, and there are no signs of stopping it.” The numbers, words, are strong enough to make many people panic: what is the future of the Programr?

# From AI Coding to AI Development to answer these questions, I think that we must first crack a core error – that is, to think that the programmer's value is a “writing code.” Dario Amodei, “90% of the code will be written by AI.”** We produce a robust system that addresses specific problems, stabilizes in a complex environment, and is capable of continuous overlap.** This process is full of business understanding, trade-off, and prognosis for future change.

- Why do you use PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB?

- Should this API be designed as synchronous or asynchronous?

- How should micro-services be split in order to balance business cohesion and team independence?

- How should the system ' s cache, downgrade, and flow-limit strategy be deployed in response to the two-nifteen flood peaks?

None of these questions can be answered independently by AI. They need experience, vision, and insight. Thus, even if AI can write 100% of the code, it cannot replace the person who defines “why” and “what” behind these codes. After the development of the code, they will have to spend a lot of effort on the environmental build-up, release the deployment, bug tracking, uplinking, etc. These non-code parts take up more than 60% of the time of the development process. The full text of the speech reads: “Taling the technology admirals: TRAE wants to do it,” and Trae is trying to introduce the AI, but it is the way in which the AI is trying to do it.

# The real Real AI Engineeringer is the “human body of collaboration.” Even when AI Coding is becoming stronger, Hong Ding Kwan has repeatedly stressed in his speech that the true “Real AI Engineer” must be the product of close collaboration between AI. In developing his own English language-learning application, he has been involved in architecture design, process control, logical review, and so on, although 85% of the code is generated by AI. Even in the case of AI debug failure, he has to return to “man-made intervention” to solve the problem.

- A precise and complete description of needs in one sentence;

- I can see where the AI-generated program will fall into the pit;

- Ties operations, tools, models into a smooth flow line. When product managers, designers, and even operations can “talk to code”, developers become “symphonic commands” linking business to AI -- know technology and know business rhythm.

One of the words that was mentioned several times in the speech was: “AI can do a lot, but it's still human.” The current AI coding tool, although it can write a full code, is still very difficult for ordinary people, so I think that one phase of AI Coding should be a closer “human body”, and that humans would only need creative guidance, simple support, process control, and security clearance, and that the rest would be done by AI.

# For everyone to write the code, AI is the bridge to “technology inclusion.” In addition to professional programmers, HUN DingQin shares a special case: an 11-year-old child, with the help of his father (a byte R & D engineer), developed an ocular topic grab and practice website using Trae. Behind this story, Trae is trying to lower the “development threshold” to allow non-professionals to participate in the construction of the digital world.

- Compiling language to C language and opening up the first system-level developers;

- C to Java/Python to promote the rise of Internet product developers;

- Front-end visualization, low-code platforms, which enable non-engineers to build functions;

- In the future, as AI's programming capacity increases, it may be possible for "people who don't have the code to build the product."

In Trae’s case, the 11-year-old child completed the project, which included not only reptiles logic, interface design, but also interactive and topic bank management with data interfaces, a task that in the past had to be completed with complete CS training. Now, with AI’s help, he has step-by-step guidance systems to generate codes, not only “workable” but also “runable.” This marks a turning point: **AI is not just a tool to improve development efficiency, but rather a key to breaking technical barriers**.

## If AI can do all the code writings, is it possible for everyone to “program”? The problem is a technical idealism at first sight, but it's a reality that is happening: today, “programming” is moving from a skill to a capability interface. Like using a search engine and making slides,** you don't need to have control of the implementation mechanisms behind it, but you don't need to know how to use it.** If we admit that the code is a language of communication between people and computers, then AI's intervention is like creating a ** real-time translation**. This translator understands your intentions and how machines should be implemented. You tell it: “I need a list to pass on, automatically divide.” If we finish the code, adjust the style, deploy the line, you don't need to care whether POST is going back or not, without imprinting it.

## The future of “programming for all” is not a fantasy, but a necessity for ecological evolution. The fall in technological thresholds is essentially a process of productivity release.

- In education, 10-year-olds can also use AI for web applications;

- At the working level, market operations can independently produce tools to analyse data;

- At the start-up level, independent creators have the ability to build a business model for MVP prototypes.

As Hong Dingkun put it, the best point of **AI Coding is perhaps not to make professional programmers faster, but to allow “non-programmers to do so.” From “engineers explode” to “everyone can program,” AI’s programming tools bring not skills migration, but a redistribution of technical powers.

# # When everyone can programme, where does the programmer come from? AI is recasting the definition of programming at the speed of the eye, and seems to be unstoppable. ** When 11-year-olds can build websites in natural languages, ** when non-engineers can automatically generate interactive pages, ** when large models can generate, calibrate, and go online, the business modules. ** They are no longer the exclusive skills of a few, but they are becoming a universal capacity for popular participation. ** When everyone can programme, is it important to assess the quality of the program?** The answer is -- ** is more important than ever, but their role has to change completely. ** Slowly, the programmers are no longer the ones who write the code, they are the ones who understand the needs of human beings, the system of architecture, and they are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are able to build it, and they are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are able to change it. ** It is not the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are not the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that
