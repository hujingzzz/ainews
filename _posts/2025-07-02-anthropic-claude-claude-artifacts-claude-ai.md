Anthropic announced two completely new ways of creating for Claude: **Artifacts creation:** Users can create, save and share in it what they make with Claude. For example, you can create a rhythm machine with Claude (as shown in the video) and share it with others. **Alimentation:** When you create these things, Claude's AI capabilities can be embedded directly, without applying for API, and you can publish directly the applications you create. For example, you create a learning tool, Claude's AI can provide personalized guidance or answers based on the skill level of the user. When you share these built-in AIs, others can use them through their Claude accounts.

# Artifacts creative spaces

## What is Claude Artifacts? Claude Artifacts is an interactive AI application construction module launched by Anthropic, which can be understood as generated in the Claude Chat interface** with Claude's intelligent ability to run "microapplications" or prototype systems**. ** Features: **

- ** No deployment or writing of codes**: No API Key configuration, nor any concern about deploying servers or calling charges.

- **Local run + Quick Share**: Runs directly at Claude interface, and clicks on publication to share other people's experiments.

- ** There is some logic and interactivity**: although a lightweight prototype, it is able to respond to user input and perform basic logical operations.

# ** Principal function**

- Provide a centralized interface to manage all Claude-generated projects and creations.

- Users can ** view selected examples**.

- All Artifact projects can be **'fork'** - i.e. copied and personalized.

- Includes a variety of templates, such as games, flashcards, programming tools, creative exercises, etc. (see screenshots and videos).[]! (https://assets-v2.Circle. so/6l66pijrmzdswmikl0jidklo6an)

- ** Using scenes** Educational applications: generating interactive learning tools

- Programming learning: Quick fix code small tools or demonstration projects

- Creative writing and game design: design AI participatory interactive content

# The ability to embed AI into the creation of Artifacts has been integrated into the Claude model, and no further API Key or backend service is required. Your use of Claude's Artifact is actually calling the reasoning of the model itself, as long as you operate within Claude platform, the amount used is assigned to your account, and no more separate fees are charged.

- ** Core function** Users can use Claude's intelligence,** directly embed AI function** in their work, and create functional AI applications.

- After the application is issued, users are required to use their own Claude account login** to achieve cost independence (no token or amount of the original author).**

Let's just say you made an "AI Emotional Analytic Small Tool" with Claude Artifacts and published a link: you sent a friend A.

- Friends A clicks on the link and logs into their Claude account;

- Friends A begin to enter text, Claude analyses emotions and returns results;

- ** These operations consume friends A's own subscriptions, not yours**.

** Features**

- Supports full functionality App building, using Claude's ability as the "backend intelligence core".

- For creators, developers and individuals who want to deploy AI applications.

- In a form similar to “AI — services”, the original author is not required to bear the operating costs.

# How to enable #

- All Claude **Free, Pro and Max users** can open the function.

- Method of operation: Enter Claude settings, ** Start test function for "Create AI-powed artifacts"**.

- Entry: https://claude.ai/artifacts

# Use Claude Artifacts prototype to develop AI application guides

# ** How quickly to build, test and share an AI application based on Claude** We used to find it difficult to do an AI application: you have to do an API key, set the server, clear the cost, handle the flow, and be careful not to step on the pit. Now, with **Claude's artifacts**, everything is much easier. It's like a "small program engine" in Claude -- no server needs to be deployed, no API keys, Claude's own "magic interfaces", so you can use prompt to move it, and you can start testing and share it once you want to do something.

# First step: open Claude's "AI application mode" and open Claude's website and open "Create AI-powed applications" in the settings; when open, Claude can identify what you want to create as an application prototype with AI capabilities, not simply a conversation; pick a chest, and you can just say, "Help me make a chat robot, and every time a user says something, it boasts about each other."

- Explain your intentions.

- Auto Generate Artifact with interactive features (click on right panel)

- Allow you to interact with Artifact.

# # prompt design advice:

- Clear expression of input and desired output

- The need for multiple rounds of dialogue, format constraints, style, etc.

- Example: “User inputs a sentence, Claude returns a gentle sentence (Positive / Neutral / Negative) encouraging and labelling emotional types.”

# Step 2: Test with your Artifact 1. Real-time test to enter content on the right of the Artifact panel to see whether the response meets expectations. 2. Fork & Edit (create branch overlap) Unsatisfactory with the results?

- Go back to any dialogue record and click on "Edit"

- Modify Prompt or description to generate a new version of Artifact

- Support multi-version parallel testing without prejudice to the original version

Note: Claude's Artifact currently supports **text completion logic** suitable for AI applications such as content generation, classification, summing up, dialogue simulation, etc.

# Don't know what to do? A few inspired directions that Claude supports are not just tools, but creative works. You can start with these directions:

- ** Teaching Assistant**: for example, interactive mentors or learning partners, understand the context of user learning needs. ** Content generation tool**: assistant to assist in brainstorms, develop and refine the content, reduce duplication of effort. ** Analysis and decision support tool** Internal Slack post: file of demand for products that are suitable for sending to LinkIn, or input into a page (PRD).  (https://assets-v2.circle.so/m5wl6kn6gieaxu56tzppruku) ** Analysis assistant to produce content, reduce duplication of work. ** Analysis and decision support tool **; processing user data and supporting decision-making with smart tools (PRD).

# Step 3: Publish and share your AI application, Claude artifacts, was created for "prototype design" and you don't need to get on a server or register API key, click "Publish," and you can generate a link to friends, colleagues, even on social platforms.

- When someone opens it, it's your current version;

- The other party can copy and adapt without affecting your original code;

- You can also cancel sharing or managing shared works at any time. [https://assets-v2.circle.so/azlyd3b9hlbbzv4chb0l4xvppe] 1. Click on the "Public" release application with a "Public" button on the upper right corner of the Artifact panel to generate the only access link. 2. Share links to test for others.

- Others click the link to run your AI application

- The modification will not affect your original version.

- Could be used for product demonstration, user testing or team collaboration development

View the published content and see all artifact applications that you have published on the "Published" tab of the Claude platform.

# Step four: Importing the prototype to the product Artifacts is the ideal platform for fast testing and displaying ideas, but when you prepare to go online as an official product, although Artifact itself cannot be deployed as a product, you can:  Exporting the code Claude automatically generates a reusable structure code (HTML/JS/CS) in the artifact.  Importing the local development environment Copying the code to your familiar development environment (e.g. Voscode, Replit) for enhanced development:

- Add external API call

- Expand front-end interactive style

- Integrated database or back-office services

Claude Code Helps you with the Claude Code model to work on code architecture optimization, functionality development, Bug restoration, etc.[3] [https://assets-v2.Circle.so/mgvk31nnql6d6skrvvvvvxncko] prototypes have been developed, thought out, tested, and the rest is engineering.

# How to build Claude's application efficiently?

- ** Let Claude in turn interview you**: tell him you have an idea that will ask you some key questions and lead the way;

- ** Use more “please modify” such natural language instructions**: for example, “help me change to a blue theme”, “limit the response to no more than 100 words”, “add a copy button”;

- ** tune bugs can also be used as chats**: for example, "This calculator cannot count decimals", "This conversation has a problem jumping," Claude will understand and fix it;

- ** Bold branch test**: Create branch version by "editing" at any time, try different logic and do not have to destroy the original version.

# Summing up: Claude Artifacts whose Gospel is? Claude Artifacts is a powerful tool for non-professioners and product prototype designers. It allows you to validate the AI product idea at minimal development cost and quickly present it as an interactive experience. Thinking of building AI applications from 0 to 1?

- ** Unable to write codes but creative**: Claude can help you land from 0 to 1 quickly;

- ** Product manager, operator, content creator**: no longer limited to "one idea but no one to do it"

- **Developer**: new ideas can be tested quickly and no longer start from blank pages;

- ** Entrepreneur**: light asset validation MVP, fast to fly.
