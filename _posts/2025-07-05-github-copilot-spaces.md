GitHub introduces a new feature **Copilot Spaches**, which enhances Copilot’s ability to understand the context of the project. This function allows developers** to centralize the context of the project**, thereby allowing GitHub Copilot to provide more **relevant and intelligent code advice and support**. The engineering team often faces a fundamental problem:** knowledge fragmentation**. Information such as code, document, design description, development decision-making is spread over multiple locations (or in the brain of team members) to make it difficult for developers to quickly access a project or collaborate efficiently. **Copilot Spaches is designed to address this problem**. It provides more precise, relevant advice and support through ** construction of the context centre (context hub)**, allowing GitHub Copilot to have a deeper, systematic understanding of the project, thus providing more precise, relevant advice and support. # Core function[s] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/lhnqn2nz6ndzdzddz7x5wa).

## 1. ** Contextual perception: let Copilot understand "What are you doing"** Copilot Spaces allows you to merge the following into a "Space":

- Source code (directly binding GitHub repository)

- Project documents, instructions, design specifications (specs)

- Remarks, guidance or FAQ

- Custom Commands

In this way (https://assets-v2.circle.so/2pbmx4i7bw384a4i9utmo5v44o28), Copilot is no longer “simple guessing” but, like an in-house developer who knows everything about the project, can answer:

- What does this module do?

- Why do you use this structure?

- Is there an example code?

- Is some kind of best practice followed?

##2. **Organization sharing: Team-level knowledge recovery accelerator** You can create one or more Copilot Spaces for the whole organization:

- Immediately upon joining, colleagues are given a unified context and no longer “be aware of the code library from scratch”

- Support rapid onboarding, knowledge inheritance, cross-sectoral collaboration

- More structured than a document library, more intelligent than README

This leaves Copilot not just as a personal assistant, but as a team's “situation AI collaborators”.

##3. **Automated synchronization: No manual maintenance of code copy** You do not need to copy paste files, but only bind the warehouse**, Copilot Space can automatically:

- Get the latest version of the code and document

- Autosync with project updates (real time to reflect changes)

- Keep an accurate understanding of the current state

This ensures that Copilot always responds to questions on the basis of “up-to-date, real” projects. # (https://assets-v2.Circle.so/f5xvhuhqyj5irlrn0s91irrk5wqsii)

- **Online**: Full opening since 4 June

- **Who can use**: All Copilot users have access to Spaches

- Business users need to use this function by the organizational administrator

** Costing rules**:

- Pay user (Pro, Pro+, Business, Enterprise): one dialogue per dialogue when using "premium"

- The use of the base model is free of charge.

Free user:

- Up to 50 times a month (including Copilot Chat)
