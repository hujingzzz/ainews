It combines the functions of soundboards, drums, and environmental noise generators to support real-time play, looping, and save presets that are suitable for many creative scenes. You can play, group, loop sound effects, or generate new AI sound effects by clicking on buttons, grouping, looping them, or making them available through texttips and formatting them into your own preset** sound panel (soundboard)**.

- Simple operation, web-based, without the need for installation;

- Integrating AI sound generation and high creative flexibility;

- Multi-speakable simultaneous broadcast, suitable for a rich simulation of the scene;

- Storage, classification and customization to facilitate long-term content management;

- Provide multiple high-quality preset combinations suitable for open boxes.

This tool is well suited to ** content creators, anchorers, game players, voice designers, cutters** because it integrates sound management, creation and triggers into a visual platform that is simple but fully functional.

# Core function details

- ** Text to Audio Generation (Text-to-SFX)** Users can generate sound through text descriptions, such as " Thunder in Storm" or "Sci-fi Laser Shooting" and SB-1 will use AI to generate the corresponding audio clips.

- Support for multilingual descriptions, including in English, Japanese (e.g., “synthetic linguization”) and so on, which enhances the accessibility of users worldwide.

- Sound generated can be played in real time, looped or saved as presets to facilitate reuse.[] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/06st8cd6923a18i13opwh9kuayzy) - **Advantages: ** No manual search for material is required;

- The content is original and the copyright is clear;

- Support for high-free creative expression.

** Multifunctional soundboard**

- ** Custom soundboard**: The user can create an unlimited number of soundboards, each containing multiple slots, supporting the uploading of existing sound, the use of prefabricated sound or the generation of new sound.

- ** real-time play**: Click on the board " pad " to play sound effects and support simultaneous performance of multiple sound effects suitable for immediate response in live or game.

- SB-1 is not limited to a single sound, but can also generate rhythm drums (drum machine) and persistent environmental sound (e.g. white noise, forest sound) as ideal tools for music production or video sounding.

** Preset and custom soundboard management** You can switch to two sound pools as follows:

- **Default Presets**: hotlists of sound combinations provided by the platform, including: environmental (Ambient): sound of rain, thunder, flame, wind, bug, etc.;

- Videos (Movie/TV): Explosion, gunshots, laughs, screams, etc.

- Animals (Animals): Dogs, cats, birds, etc.
