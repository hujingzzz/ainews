At its core is the use of large language models.LLMI'm not sure what I'm talking about.Direct voice generation Instead of relying on traditional layer-by-storey structures,I don't know.The system has an unprecedented emotional expression.Style ControlA lot of people understand.Equivalence of non-linguistic sound generation And through self-researching audio.TokenSystemSNACI'm not sure what I'm talking about.It's more real.It's more manageable.More context-specific synthesizingI don't know.

## Function Highlights

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Voice style controlStyle TransferI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- Models can be used. **‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Context learningIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.**‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Context learningIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea. It's an automatic understanding of what it is.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,An exciting tone.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.or‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Calm down.); and

- You can also manually add control tags Like-
<excited> It's a big breakthrough. <calm> Please read the following instructions carefully.I don't know. 
- Just need to...3~6It's a voice example. The system can synthesize new content in the same style.I don't know.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sound GenerationSound EffectsI'm not sure what I'm talking about.
It's not just a synthetic language. It's okay.**Generate Sound**Generate Sound Like-
<dog_bark> It's a dog barking. <laughter> Simulate laughter. As long as you've given me an example of a punctuation and audio. Models can remember the relativity.I don't know.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Voice mixVoice BlendingI'm not sure what I'm talking about.
By providing examples of multiple voices The system is automatic.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,IntegrationIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Make a new sound. We both keep the character of more than one person talking. And there's consistency in the tone.I don't know.Applicable to-

- Brand voice design;

- Multilingual unified style output;

- Virtual image role creationI don't know.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Voice-to-mouth understanding.Emotionally AwareI'm not sure what I'm talking about.
The system isn't anymore.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Just read it.I'm not sure what I'm going to do.It's really a change of tone based on context.‚Äî‚Äî

- Technology introductions are more rational.;

- Comfortable content is warmer.;

- Questions and answers are more natural.I don't know.

### üéß A breakthrough at the data level-A thousand times higher.
Bottom of any generation system It's all data quality.I don't know.Bland The team thinks... Public voice data isn't enough. Especially in real dialogue modelling.I don't know.
They built one. **Top industry large-scale dialogue voice dataset**Top industry large-scale dialogue voice dataset Having the following characteristics:-

## Core of the technical architecture-From Text LLM To voice LLM

### üß† LLMGeneral thinking
Tradition LLM It's the way it works.-
Split Text into Text Token ‚Üí Learn to predict the next one. Token ‚Üí Revert to full sentence
Bland The method.-
Sever the text. ‚Üí Predictions correspond to‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Audio TokenIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea. ‚Üí Revert to voice wave shape

- Macro beatAs fast as a word.Stop.);

- Micro DetailsIt's a pronunciation.SoundI'm sorry, I don't know.

This way, the model can really be mastered at the same time.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Contents+OrganisationI'm not sure what I'm going to do.That's right.That's a good one.I don't know.
