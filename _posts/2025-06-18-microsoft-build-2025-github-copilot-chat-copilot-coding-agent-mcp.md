### üìå Background and drivers
The Microsoft team summarized the current situation.AISeveral key changes in development and community feedback And use it as a basis for decision-making to advance open sources-
1. **Large model capability evolution. That's right.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Cubic TipsIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Dependence**Large model capability evolution. That's right.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Cubic TipsIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Dependence
Get over there. In order to get a better production effect, AI Tools often need to use private tips to optimize their policies;But now the big model itself is much more generalized. ‚ô™ Makes this ‚ô™‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Privatization fine-tuningIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.The strategy is no longer the core barrier.I don't know.
2. **User ExperienceUXI'm not sure what I'm talking about.Modes have matured.**User ExperienceUXI'm not sure what I'm talking about.Modes have matured.
In Different Editors AI Interactive approachLike a chat windowAutocode Completion Styles, etc.I'm not sure what I'm talking about.It's becoming more standardized.I don't know.Microsoft wants to promote open-source sharing of these functions. Encouraging communities to continue grindingI don't know.
3. **AI The plugin ecology is expanding.**AI The plugin ecology is expanding.
Developers want to build themselves. AI Plugins But because... Copilot Chat Plugins are closed. Debug and higher acceptance limitsI don't know.After open source Developers can learn more easily to achieve logic and achieve depth integrationI don't know.
4. **Increased transparency in the use of data**Increased transparency in the use of data
Community user interest VS Code AI What's the data collected from the plugin? After open source plugin All the data-processing logic will be clear. Contribution to confidence-buildingI don't know.
5. **Increased security. Using communities to detect loopholes**Increased security. Using communities to detect loopholes
Historic experience. Open source helps to detect and repair security gaps more quickly.I don't know.Yeah. AI Editor for This open mechanism is particularly important.I don't know.

### üß© Technical programmes and follow-up planning
üîì **Copilot Chat Plugin Open Source**Copilot Chat Plugin Open Source

- Plugin code will be used **MIT License**MIT License Delegation of authority;

- When the source is opened, the core functions will be gradually phased out.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Disassemble and merge.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Present. VS Code Core module;

- All contributors can participate in the optimization and re-engineering of the pluginI don't know.

üß™ **The hint test frame will also be open**The hint test frame will also be open

- In response to the reasoning of the big model,‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Non-determinate issuesI'm not sure what I'm going to do.Microsoft will open up internal use.**prompt Test Frame**prompt Test Frame;

- This will help contributors submit Pull Request _Other OrganiserWhether output is controlledI don't know.

üß© **Developer contribution path will be simplified**Developer contribution path will be simplified

- AI The functions will be related to other VS Code Core functions are as easy to participate in.;

- Future contributions promptUI LogicalModel access logic will all have uniform standards.I don't know.

üìå Version management and progress tracking

- All developments will be updated on a monthly basis VS Code It's... it's... it's... Iteration Plan;

- Official FAQ The page will answer common questions in the community simultaneously.I don't know.

### üí° Actual value after open source
‚úÖ Meaning for developers
Dimensions Annotations Plugin Development You can learn the source code for pluginsReuse generic componentsBetter debug Access custom model I don't depend on the government anymore. Copilot Replaced with Other LLM Security and data Identify which data will be collected and used Enhancing trust Contribution threshold Lower learning curve More complete testing infrastructure support
‚úÖ The whole thing. AI The significance of programming ecology

- Providing a stable open source infrastructure Promoting the development of standardization;

- Encouraging global developers to collaborate Diversifying plugins and model-adaptation layers;

- Promote AI Programmed from‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Product testingIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Heading‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Developer Custom Tool ChainsIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.The New EraI don't know.

## New Programming Agent-Copilot Coding Agent

It's no longer just an auxiliary writing code. It's one that can take the initiative.**Implementation of development tasks**Implementation of development tasksIt's... it's... it's...‚ÄúAt the end of the day,AIProxyAgentI'm sorry, I'm sorry.

### Core competencies and workflows
1. **Job-Driver Autodevelopment**Job-Driver Autodevelopment

- You can do whatever you want. GitHub Issue Allocation Copilot AgentPass. WebCLIVS CodeGitHub App And so on and so forth.I'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- Agent It's automatic.-
Activate a secure virtual environment.Based on GitHub ActionsI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

3. **Multi-model call capabilityMCPProtocol supportI'm not sure what I'm talking about.**Multi-model call capabilityMCPProtocol supportI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- Pass. **Model Context ProtocolMCPI'm not sure what I'm talking about.**Model Context ProtocolMCPI'm not sure what I'm talking about. Agent Accessible non-requirements GitHub Data Sourcese.g. within the enterprise API or external document databaseI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- User can configure custom in project settings MCP Server


### Security and authority control mechanisms
In order to ensure the safety of the team code library, Copilot Agent Designed a set of strict protection strategies.-

### Use of scenes and applicable boundaries
üí° Type of task applicable-

- Medium and Low ComplexityNeed clear.A clear mandate for the border
Bug RepairUnit Test CompletionCode ReconstructDocument update etc.

- Initial realization needs templateMigration code structureSplit Logical Modules, etc.

üß≠ Not applicable to scenes-

- It's very innovative.Lack of clear contextCross-domains rely on a great deal of tasks.

- Needs requiring a great deal of subjective judgement and in-depth product understanding

### Integrated approach and environmental support

- Default operating environment-**GitHub Actions**GitHub Actions

- Local Agent Mode Support-VS CodeXcodeEclipseJetBrainsVisual Studio Waiting for the mainstream. IDE

- Enterprise users can set the activation policy uniformly Control which items can be enabled Agent Mode

### Description of usage policy and costing

- **User-oriented**User-oriented-Copilot Enterprise and Copilot Pro+ User-available

- **From 2025Year6Month4Day Get up.**From 2025Year6Month4Day Get up. Every time Agent The request will be counted as one.**Advanced Copilot Request**Advanced Copilot Request For billing settlement

### And tradition. Copilot The difference.
