AI Research announced that the system of “manual scientists” they developed **Zochi**,** had independently completed the complete scientific process from topic selection to experiment to writing and writing**, the results of which — a research paper on multiple rounds of escape attacks, which had been officially accepted by the ACL 2025 conference (Main Proceedings) ** [https://assets-v2.circle.so/iqmhe8bzdwazhi1fva62l5wmw47www], was not only a technological breakthrough in the automation of scientific research, but more probably a turning point in the scientific paradigm**: artificial intelligence can not only “assist” scientific research,** it has “leaded” scientific research**.

- **Zochi is a system of artificial scientists developed by Intology** and became the first AI system** to adopt the ACL draft autonomously**.

- It can automatically do literature overviews, topic selection, methodological innovation, experimental design and validation, paper writing

- ACL is the highest international conference in the field of natural language processing, with a main intake rate of about 20 per cent, with a high level of technical depth, innovation and experimental integrity**.

- Zochi's thesis Tempest received a meta-review rating of 4, in the top 8.2%.

The study "Tempest," published by Zochi, shows how language models can be “relaxed” step by step through natural dialogue, and ends with what should be banned. Tempest has a 100% success rate on GPT-3.5-turbo, 97% on GPT-4, exceeding existing methods.

#Zochi’s research process architecture Zochi is not a non-traditional “AI assistant” but an independent agent (agent) with end-to-end scientific research capabilities. Its research processes include:

# 1.  Documentation autoanalyzing

- Swallow thousands of papers and build knowledge maps automatically

- Determining current research bottlenecks and development pathways

- Specially good at discovering the hidden connections** across literature**

##2.  Research direction selected

- The initial input is only "researched in general directions" (e.g., LLM escape attack)

- System-owned identification** of specific research issues** and methodological pathways

- In this study, Zochi focuses on the combination of "multicycle escape + tree search strategy"

#3.  Experimental design and automated validation

- Automation of experimental programmes, preparation of test scripts

- Standard data sets are fixed throughout the process, resulting in more repossibility

- Multiple rounds of parallel testing have significantly increased the speed of validation:** the full project cycle will only take a few days**

# 4.  Writing and submission of papers

- Automatically writing the entire paper (including summaries, methods, experiments, conclusions)

- Humans are only involved in chart production, formatting and citation

- Zochi is not listed as author, only uses the system in the thanks component

#  Title of the paper: **Tempest: Automotic Multi-Turn Jailbreaing of Large Language Models with TreSearch**

# # Question: How to design more efficient ** multi-cycle escape methods (multi-turn Jailbreak)** and break through the dialogue security restrictions of large language models (e.g. GPT-4).

## Method: The Tempest system (tree search + dialogue optimization) Zochi proposes a new approach called **Tempest**:[] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/78gmhdgixby 1g8cuzpenr85iymg5)  In short: Tempest, by simulating natural dialogue, progressively “closing” the security limitations of the language model with multiple stages of questioning, is more effective than the traditional “one word attack”.

# Experimental results: [] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/7d9yic8cy0k9x2533oigczvhnga0) - Tempest not only has been more successful** but also ** has used fewer queries** (more efficient);

- Experimental methods are complete and rigorous and include comparison experiments, digestion experiments and multi-model tests.

# The meaning of research:

- To reveal the risk of a “step-by-step compromise” in the dialogue security strategy of the large-language model**;

- New analytical tools and ideas were provided for the security protection of language models;

- The provision of a methodological framework to help design stronger defence mechanisms.

**Paper:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10619** dissertations:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10619![] (https://assets-v2.Circle.so/spqj223r60mdz8w215snmzqwg39b) ## Why was this a milestone breakthrough? ** The first independent adoption by AI of the A* conference review **

- ACL is one of the most authoritative global meetings in the field of natural language processing; Zochi became the first AI to adopt its official draft.

** “Automated scientific research” closed **

- In the past, AI had been able only to support the preparation of summaries or the collation of data, and now Zochi has the ability to ** raise new scientific issues and solve them**.

** Efficient quality**

- The entire research cycle, from conception to the completion of the paper, takes only a few days**, which is dozens of times faster than traditional human researchers.

** Research depths are hard**

- Zochi ' s thesis received a final score of 4 points, ranking among the top 8.2 per cent of the contributions, exceeding the majority of human authors.

# Zochi's next direction

#  Beta project released: The Intology project published Zochi to the public and launched in stages: ** Model for scientific collaborators** (initial stage):

- Assistance in the selection of topics, preparation of proposals for the Fund, design experiments, preparation of general papers, etc.;

- Greater emphasis on teamwork with human researchers.

** Autonomous scientific model** (later):

- Complete automated research capacity, gradually opening up its full-process functionality.
