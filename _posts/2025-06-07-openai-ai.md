## üß≠ What is it? Codex
**Codex**Codex Yes. OpenAI A cloud-based project AI Software Development Assistant You can handle multiple tasks in parallel.I don't know.It's designed to be...-
**Replacing or supporting programmer to complete duplicationCheap.Time-consuming programming tasksI don't know.**Replacing or supporting programmer to complete duplicationCheap.Time-consuming programming tasksI don't know.
It doesn't just write the code.Answer questions on the itemFind and fix errors I can still make it look like it.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Generate test codeI'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.Submit Pull RequestCode merger applicationI'm not sure what I'm going to do.A standard development mission like this.I don't know.

- Repair bug

- Reconstruct code

- Add Test

- Review the code.

- Generate code changes according to natural language needs

Every task will be carried out in an isolated cloud environment. This environment has pre-positioned your code library. And that's why... Codex Adequate context to understand and address the problemI don't know.
![](https://assets-v2.circle.so/k7d7opfjgs3kq0ipxr38saibbfsy)Codex Yes. OpenAI It's... it's... it's... **o3 Series Model**o3 Series ModelOn the basis of this, the software development has been fine-tuned.fine-tunedI'm sorry, I don't know.

## üîß Codex What can I do?
Codex It's one.**Multifunctional programming agent system**Multifunctional programming agent system With the following capabilities:-

## üîç Codex The working principles are explained in detail.
Codex It's not a simple code generator. It's a possession.**Clouds of self-execution AI Programming AgentagentI'm not sure what I'm talking about.**Clouds of self-execution AI Programming AgentagentI'm not sure what I'm talking about.I don't know.It runs like a remote developer. I'm doing a specific job for you in the clouds.I don't know.

- **Cloud Implementation**Cloud ImplementationIt's not running on your computer.I'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- **Task Driver**Task DriverYou have a clear goal. CodexIndependently completedI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- **Traceable**TraceableYou can see what you do every step of the way.I'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- **Limited autonomy**Limited autonomyCodexNo, it's not.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Free play.I'm not sure what I'm going to do.It's an efficient solution to the problem around the mission.I'm not sure what I'm talking about.

### üìä Codex Model mechanisms
Codex It's used by a name. codex-1 Models of the It's based on OpenAI It's... it's... it's... o3 Series optimization training:Its intelligent behavior relies on the following mechanisms:-
![](https://assets-v2.circle.so/1kknxlbhmwfsv9w7b3hz2fk543q3)
### üß± 1. Could not close temporary folder: %s-Enter Command
You're a user. Pass. ChatGPT sidebar or Codex CLI Tool requests Like what?-

- ‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Add a user-registry feature to my projectIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.

- ‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Explanation utils.py What's the function in the file?It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.

- ‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Fix one of the login processes bugIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.

- ‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Write me a test example and run it.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.

These requests can be in natural languages. It could be a clear development mission statement.I don't know.

### üß† 2. Codex Parsing Tasks-Understanding intent and planning implementation
Codex Use the large language model behind it. **codex-1**codex-1It's an intensive training. AI ModelI'm not sure what I'm talking about.Come on.-

- **Understand your request.**Understand your request.

- **Analysis of project contextCodeStructureFile ExistingI'm not sure what I'm talking about.**Analysis of project contextCodeStructureFile ExistingI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- **Develop a rational strategy for implementation**Develop a rational strategy for implementation-New files, for example.Modify Existing DocumentsRun Test Wait.

If you're configured in the code library, **AGENTS.md**AGENTS.md Documentation Codex We'll use the notes to get the job done more accurately. For example...-

- How to run the testWhich command to useI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- Code style or development specifications for the project

- Key modules or document structure of the project

### üß™ 3. Codex Activate quarantine.Sandbox containerI'm not sure what I'm talking about.
Every mission starts on the cloud.**A completely segregated enforcement environment**A completely segregated enforcement environment It's like opening a unique virtual developer on a cloud.-

- Pre-positioned your project's code library.Pass. GitHub Waiting for integrationI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- Configured Reliance ItemsTest frame and tool chain

- Internet access is disabled Make sure it's safe.Could not close temporary folder: %s APII'm not sure what I'm talking about.

It's in this environment. Codex It's like...‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Entered your project directory.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.remote developers Could not close temporary folder: %sRun and modify files in itemsI don't know.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Codex Implementation of the mandate-Write Code + Run Command
When the environment's ready, Codex We'll start working on the job.-

- Read & Write File-CreateModifyRename Code File

- Write Code-The ability to transfer codes using natural languages Generate the appropriate functionClass or Module

- Run Command-Execute TestRun lintersCode Regulator.Type checks, etc.

- Analysis of feedback-To judge whether the test is passed or not.Whether or not to report the error If necessary, adjust the code again.

It's a...**Implementation process for closed rings**Implementation process for closed rings Until the mission is completed or it's clearly failed.I don't know.

### üìÑ 5. After the mission. Codex Provide verifiable results
Once the mission's over, Codex Yes.-

- **Submit changes**Submit changesIt's like a developer's submission. Git That's the way it's submitted.I'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- Provide the following for user verification-
**Code diffWhere did you change it?I'm not sure what I'm talking about.**Code diffWhere did you change it?I'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- **Execute Command Line Log**Execute Command Line Log

- **Test pass and failure**Test pass and failure

## üìà Future directions
OpenAI Yeah. Codex Future plans include:-

- Support**Midway interactivity in the execution of mandates**Midway interactivity in the execution of mandates-User can adjust target or view intermediate results at any timeI don't know.

- Integrating with More Tools-Not just for support. GitHub I'll connect you again. IDECI/CDIssue Tracking systemI don't know.

- More complex task disassembly and multi-agent collaboration-Simulate the human team mode of workI don't know.

The ultimate goal is...-**Let developers focus on key logic and design decisions Other part by AI It's an efficient job.I don't know.**Let developers focus on key logic and design decisions Other part by AI It's an efficient job.I don't know.
