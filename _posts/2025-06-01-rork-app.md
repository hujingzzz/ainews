Rork 1.0 is an innovative tool that allows users to quickly build, test, share, and publish mobile applications, with little need for programming experience. Its slogan is “From ideas to mobile applications, only a few minutes”, with the goal of automatically converting user applications into deployable mobile applications through AI. The platform, using **ReactNative** (a Facebook-maintained cross-platform mobile development framework), combines the logic, interfaces and functionality generated by AI to help users create a full functionality of APP without ** programming experience**.

- Open Rork, enter what you want to do with App's ideas, like, "An application to record daily moods."

- It's ** Auto-generated interfaces, functions, logic**

- You can add pictures, buttons, input boxes... you just need a few points.

- The user only needs to provide a short application description, and the system will automatically understand your needs and generate a full code.

- Support the simultaneous construction of cross-platforms (iOS and Android).

- All applications generate a full code for "**can be used in the production environment**".

- Supports export source code customizing or uploading App Store/Google Play.

# ** Principal features and functions: ** 1. **In a matter of minutes, from creativity to application**

- Quick build: just enter an idea, Rork generates a mobile application.
