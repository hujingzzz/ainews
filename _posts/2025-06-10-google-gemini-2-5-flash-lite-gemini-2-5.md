**Google officially publishes Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro models,** which can now be used by any developer to construct and expand the AI applications that can be put into production.

- **In parallel with the launch of the new model Gemini 2.5** ** Flash-Lite**: This is the most responsive and least costly model in the Gemini 2.5 series.

- Particularly applicable to practical applications where low-delayed and efficient responses are required.

# A comparative overview of the three-point model![] (https://assets-v2.Circle.so/ atma49ws12l6nf8imj9whcz7ix1d) #Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite

1. The most cost-effective and fastest.

- Compared to the Pro model,** the reasoning is faster and less costly**.

- Lower than 2.0 Flash-Lite and 2.0 Flash ** Delay** and faster reasoning;

- The cost of each call is significantly reduced and suitable for deployment in large-scale systems or user scenarios.

- Light solutions for ** edge devices, mobile terminals, microservices**.

#2. Quality upgrades to base tasks, Flash-Lite, surpasses the old version on multiple standard tests:

- ** Code generation**

- **Mathematic/logical reasoning**

- **The scientific understanding mission**

- ** Text/image multi-model input parsing**

The performance is more balanced and comprehensive than 2.0 Flash-Lite.

##3. Support for Gemini 2.5 full functional capabilities including: 1. **Controlable Thinking** Gemini 2.5 Flash is one of the first models to support the "thinking budget":

- Users can set a reasoned calculation budget (e.g. the Token number) with a flexible trade-off between response speed and accuracy.

- Models can use more forward transmission steps to improve accuracy when dealing with complex tasks (e.g. mathematical questions, code generation).

2. ** Multi-module treatment** Although not pro-version, it still has complete primary multi-module support:

- Type of input includes: text, image, audio, video.

- Capable of processing **hour video content**, structured images (e.g. graphs, UI interfaces) and voice.

- Support the task of extracting events, identifying scenes, generating applications or summaries from videos.

3. **Tool-use**: for example, to call Google search, code run, etc., and have **million token context window**, the same level as Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro.

#  4. ** Performance comparison**:

2.5 Flash-Lite is a full leader in response speed, reasoning quality compared to the old version 2.0 Flash-Lite and Flash.

- Obtaining higher scores in baseline tests such as coding, mathematics, science, reasoning and multimodules.

- Delays are lower and cost lower, being one of the best value for money models at present.[] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/g0nd23e7nkk8vko6mr29s1iha75) [https://assets-v2.circle.so/juibapguef7s0olejpqasr0b7mwmmm)

## "** Whose model AI is the most cost-effective **"! [https://assets-v2.circle.so/j7dkvtyqrbuor6rf72elormfwrk) - **Gemini 2.5 series significantly increased the upper limit of value for money** by moving Pareto as a whole to the upper right corner.

- **Flash-Lite is currently one of the most cost-effective models**, especially for budget-sensitive applications that still require strong modelling capacity.

- ** “Thinking” + Long context + multi-model”** is fundamental to the leadership of the Google Gemini series.

♪ How do you look at this picture? ♪

- **Honger axis (up as high as possible): ** How smart and competent models are, for example, in terms of their ability to understand, write codes, watch videos, etc.

- ** Transverse (advanced by right): ** How much it costs to use this AI model at a time (cost of processing 1 million words).

** Top left **: Smart but expensive ** Top right**: Smart and cheap!  This is the best combination ** Blue Curve ** This is:  A line associated with “The world's most cost-effective model” ** also known as “Pareto Frontier”  Gemini 2.5 Pro

- Googles now ** the strongest AI brain**, smart as a watch.

- For example, you can read three hours of video, you can write web applications, you can read Harry Potter at once.

- Weaknesses: Precious! Suitable for scientific research and heavy development.

Gemini 2.5 Flash

- Smaller models,** smarter than GPT-4o, but cheaper**.

- Balanced: fast, cheap and reflective, suitable for chat robots, customer service, search and question systems.

Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite (new release!)

- Super-high-priced "Quick Knife Little AI": especially low-cost, but still smart!

- For example, if you have thousands of customers who have to answer questions with AI at the same time, it's perfect.

- It is represented by the “top right corner” in the figure:** the cheaper the right, the smarter the higher and the better the better.**

- A research prototype: After the user uploads large PDF files, the Flash-Lite model can be converted into an interactive Web application in real time to facilitate understanding and synthesizing complex content.

- The example highlights the strong capacity of the model in dealing with complex structured information.

# ** How to use **:

- All 2.5 Flash and Pro models can be used on the following platforms: Google AI Studio

- Google Cloud Vertex.
