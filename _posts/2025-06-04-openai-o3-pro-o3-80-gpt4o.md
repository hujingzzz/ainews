### It's more stable.-4/4 Reliability criteria
To verify the stability of the model OpenAI Used what's known as‚ÄúAt the end of the day,4/4 reliabilityI'm not sure what I'm talking about.All right in four.I'm not sure what I'm talking about.C. Criteria for critical assessmentI don't know.Only models can answer questions correctly in four consecutive attempts. That's why I think it's really reliable.I don't know.
In this assessment, o3-pro It's more than smart, as it turns out. And stable.I don't know.
