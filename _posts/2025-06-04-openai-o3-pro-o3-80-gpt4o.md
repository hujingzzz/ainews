OpenAI officially launched a new generation model, O3-Pro, which is now open to all ChatGPT professional and API users and will soon be extended to the corporate and educational versions. Compared to previous versions (e.g. o3 and o1-Pro), O3-Pro has achieved significant improvements in a number of ways. The expert review highly evaluated its capabilities in the fields of science, education, data analysis, writing and programming, and noted that it is more excellent in terms of clarity, integrity of content, compliance with directives and accuracy.

- ** The expert assessment indicates** that performance is better than that of o3,o3-pro in a number of key areas, including science, education, programming, data analysis and writing.

- O3-Pro rated higher ** clarity, comprehensiveness, command compliance and accuracy**.

- Similar to O1-Pro, **o3-Pro, excellent in mathematics, science and programming in academic assessment**.

- OpenAI's “**4/4 Reliability Assessment**” was used to test model stability - only if all of the four responses were correct will it be successful.

- O3-Pro has access to ChatGPT advanced tools: **Web search, file analysis, image recognition, Python programming, personalization of memory, etc.**

- **o3-Pro to become a default model for professional and team-based users from this very day on, replacing o1-pro**; users of enterprise and educational versions will be granted access next week.

# Performance assessment ** The evaluator generally prefers O3-Pro to O3-Pro as compared to O3 in key areas such as science, education, programming, data analysis and writing. o3-Pro achieves higher scores in clarity, comprehensiveness, command understanding and implementation, and content accuracy.[https://assets-v2.circle.so/2tqm5ftvvbxan3e6ajyw4f) and O3-Pro as compared to o1-Pro, which has shown improvement in mathematics, science and programming.[https://assets-v2.circle.so/6yt5p5kz3s5qw5jjntrn14mf) ##4 Reliability criteria, which have been confirmed by OpenAI for stability.[s://www.circile.so/6v#jt5s3s5s6kzfqqw6jtrmf) #4Sp4 #4Sp4 & 4St4 4St4 4 4 4St4 4 4 4 4S4 4 4 4 4 4St4 4 S4 4 4 4S4 4 4 4 4 4 4 .

- Performance is comparable to **Gemini 2.5 Pro** and is consistent with the intelligence index in the evaluation

- Smart is better than **Claude 4 Sonnet Tinking**, but the unit cost is lower

- Answer style ** is not as long as Claude 4 Opus**, but ** is simpler than Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek R1 **[] (https://assets-v2.Circle.so/69vzfr4ixlfoms8z32imyihkljq)

# Tool integration: Not only language models, but also smart assistants o3-pro, far more than "chat chat" AI, which brings together all the high-level tools of ChatGPT to make it a truly multi-skilled intellectual assistant:

-  **Web search**: quick search and integration of real-time information

-  Document analysis**: available for reading and understanding the contents of the uploaded document

-  Image recognition**: capable of processing visual input and understanding images

-  **Python programming capability**: direct operation code, data processing, drawing, etc.

-  Personalized memory**: Keeping in mind user preferences and continuously optimizing interactive experiences

# **o3 prices down 80% below GPT 4o **

- **OpenAI significantly reduced the price of the o3 model by 80%** from $8/$40 per million input/output token to $2/$8, while providing a discount of **75% for the cache input token**. **o3Pro price: input: $2/100 million token output: $8/100 million sign o1-Pro: $600 o3-Pro: $20 topro-pro: pro: 3 pro-pro in all respects better than o1-pro, faster, smarter and stronger. ** And the price is 30 times cheaper.[https://assets-v2.circle.so/3ta4garf7dffm1wc8827bt 9fyn] - **o3 The actual cost per token cost has been equal to GPT-4.1 ** The price between the reasoning and the non-research model is consistent with the non-research model.[https://assets-v2.circle.so/3ta4 **The average export was about 7 times higher since GPT-4.

**O3 unit token cost aligned to GPT-4.1**

- The two are at the same price as "each token".

- But it's a lot lower than GPT 4o.

- But since the number of tokens generated by o3 ** is about 7 times as high as GPT-4.1 **,** the cost of a full query is higher**

(https://assets-v2.circle.so/9llcsb9v5m7vifd3xj1oo7dak5) **AI smart costs are falling rapidly **:

- GPT-4 level smarts have declined since their release **100 times more **

- Trained models that meet the “advanced intelligence threshold” and whose economic thresholds continue to fall

- The marginal cost of user deployment of AI services has continued to decline, contributing to more landing scenes![] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/36fqnt8j9grjyx2dx7ft9ohca1] [] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/zpj67nsj2vwt2zwp8rnluxu00an) [https://assets-v2.circle.so/9j1aq7waq5milo5xum4cutiwk952]] [https://assets-v2.circle.so/9j1aq7wac5m5xum4cwk952) which means that the AI model is becoming more available, more suitable for commercialization and large-scale use.
