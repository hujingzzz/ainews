At the 2025 Google I/O Congress, Google presented a series of major upgrades to the AI assistant product under the flag **Gemini**. The update covered a number of core scenes such as search interactions, visual recognition, content generation, office integration, information processing, image and video creation, and provided a comprehensive picture of Gemini's evolution from chat robots to multi-model AI platforms. Google's goal is very clear - to make Gemini the “**most personalized, most proactive and powerful AI assistant**”.

# I ** Gemini, the personalized assistant who built a “better understand you” **, formally introduced deeper personal context capabilities. In addition to the **Survey History** functionality that already exists, future users will be able to integrate information from Google, Google Drive, calendar, keep, etc. Google applications to provide Gemini with a “everything about you” context and further enhance the individualization and relevance of the response. This marks Gemini's evolution from a passive response system to an AI partner “continuously aware of your life.”

##Gemini Live: Visual+Voice, problem solving in the field** In the real world, we often want to “point to things and ask AI”, which is now a reality. **Gemini Live** has a powerful visual and screen-sharing function that allows users to share directly by camera or screen, allowing AI to help identify problems and provide programs. This function has been open to Android and iOS users since May 20, and will be gradually extended. In addition, Gemini Live will soon be connected to Google calendars, keep, missions, maps, etc.

#iii, Deep Research: A stronger document analysis tool** Gemini also has important updates on research and analysis:

- ** Supports file and photo upload**: Users can drag PDFs, images, Word documents, etc. into the dialogue, and Gemini can understand, summarize and compare content.

- **Integration Gmail and Google Drive (on-line): ** Allow Gemini, under user authorization, to extract relevant data from mail and cloud hard disks for multiple document matching and intelligent answers.

This significantly enhanced Gemini's “information aggregation and analysis capacity” in the office landscape.

#4 **Canvas Content Generation: Chat Record Seconds Web / Podcast / Test** Canvas is a multi-model creative tool for Gemini and is now being upgraded:

- Add a new "**Create** " button to automatically generate interactive content based on the content of the current dialogue, without the need for the user to enter any more hint words.

- Supports one key to convert the output of Deep Research into various forms of **pages, podcast audio, interactive testing**.

- Fit for marketing, education, self-media, etc., to save every step of the creative process.

It's not just AI's auxiliary writing, it's AI's initiative to plan and publish.

# **v. Gemini for Chrome: AI partner in browser**Google integrated Gemini depth into chrome browser with "**Browsing Assistant**" feature:

- Users can click the Gemini icon on any page, enter or voice questions.

- Capable of ** web summaries, terminology interpretation, cross-page questions and answers** without the need to switch tabs.

- Reduce page jumps, ** good-bye tab hell**

- It will initially be launched in the United States region ' s desktop version of Gemini subscriptions.

This is the Google-driven " borderless assistant" strategy, in which AI should be seamlessly embedded and responsive in any software interface.

# ** VI, Imagen 4: Image generation further** In image generation, Google introduced an upgraded version of the model **Imagen 4**, bringing:

- Clearer and more nuanced image details.

- More natural colours.

- More reliable text and label generation

- The visual performance of people ' s faces, clothing textures, background drawings, etc. have reached new heights.

Imogen 4 All Gemini users are now open for free use without subscription to experience high-quality image creations.

- Support the generation of high-resolution video (up to 4K resolution)

- Could add ** audio, background noise, white lines**

- Understanding more complex narrative logic and dynamics

Veo 3 means that Gemini is no longer just a graphic assistant, but is also becoming “director of the image creator AI”.

# **viii. A completely new subscription system: Google AI Pro and Ultra** launched a new AI subscription level to meet the deep usage needs of different users:

- **Google AI Pro**: For day-to-day step users

- **Google AI Ultra** Created for high-level creators and professionals to provide: Higher frequency of use and length of context

- Faster response speed.

- Testing of state-of-the-art models such as Veo 3, Imagen 4 in advance

Ultra clearly shows the ambition of Google in the high-end AI market by paying users of ChatGPT for OpenAI.[https://assets-v2.circle.so/tjprijy4o1yt70vvxlg2y93lp1x] #**Gemini is becoming an “AI operating system”** This Google Gemini upgrade, which is no longer limited to talking questions or web helpers, but generally moves towards an “AI working hub” that integrates vision, language, content, tools, behaviour. Gemini not only “to answer questions”, but more “to deal with”, “to integrate the context”, “to produce the results”, “to make recommendations”, but may in the future become an “AI executive” in a personal workflow.

# Other updates

# **Google Meet Add Real Time AI Simultaneous Translator** Google Meet Introduced AI Voice Translator with initial support for dialogue between English and Spanish. Most important:

- **Retain the original voice, tone and tone of the user** and not change the style of the language

- Auto-synchronization of the content of a movie like that.

This is a key development for AI in the area of voice, not just in terms of comprehension, but rather in terms of “** real-time translation + simulating synthesizing**”, approaching the real AI simultaneous interpreters.

# **Flow: AI-driven film studios are empty ** Google has launched a brand-new creative platform:

- seamless integration of Veo, Imagen, Gemini.

- Keeping the image, style, background consistent in different lenses

- Independent creators can produce a full film (including animation, dialogue, style) on their own

This is not just video generation; it is a complete "**AI narrative platform**" equivalent to a mix of Midjourney + ChatGPT + Runway + Premiere.

# Google virtual dress trial tool

A.I. will generate an actual picture of you wearing the merchandise in a few seconds.

- Based on a new generation of image-generation models, designed for fashion scenes.

- Provision of real-time credible commodity information based on global commodity data of 50 billion

- Multiple-conditional search and comparison, price analysis, depending on the user ' s needs.

- The shopping process is fully automated, and the bill can be paid automatically.

## Google发布 Gemini Diffusion 基于扩散机制的模型 
速度可达 2000 token/秒 性能媲美Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite从传统的“逐词生成”转向“一次生成，逐步迭代”Gemini Diffusion 特别擅长代码生成，几乎可以实时写出高质量代码，编码速度达到了2000 tokens/秒。Gemini Diffusion的工作方式：先将一个“完整的文本表示”加入噪声破坏，然后训练模型逐步“去噪”，恢复为合理文本。
**优势：**- 允许整体式生成：可以一开始生成一个大致草稿，然后反复迭代改进；- 天然支持纠错与编辑：因为本质上每一步都在“调整”内容；- 适合复杂结构的生成：如数学、编程语言，要求结构和语义严谨。

## NotebookLM 推出「视频摘要」功能预告
在 2025 年 Google I/O 大会上，Google 旗下的笔记式 AI 助手平台 **NotebookLM** 宣布了一个令人惊喜的新功能 —— **Video Overviews（视频摘要）**。
通过这项功能，用户将能从各类内容源（如 PDF、图片、文档等）中**自动生成短视频摘要**。虽然目前仅支持英文，但这一更新无疑将 NotebookLM 从一个“文本型知识整理工具”，升级为一个支持“**多模态内容生成**”的 AI 学习平台。
**从任意上传内容生成视频**
无论是 PDF 报告、笔记图片、网页内容、文稿，NotebookLM 都将支持以这些资料为基础生成视频。这意味着：

- The academic thesis generates a Coptic video.

PDF can be converted into a video presentation.

- Picture Note Visual Output

** Generates a short video summary** with an emphasis on "overview", which is a quick overview:

- Short video (possibly within 1-2 minutes)

- Content extraction, suitable for fast-paced learning, content redisk, social media sharing

# **Other forewords: Agent Mode, Project Mariner, multi-end API call**

- **Agent Mode:** Gemini will be able to carry out tasks such as filling out forms, processing web content, etc.

- **Project Mariner Multitask AI Module** (priority for Ultra subscribers in the United States region)

- **Gemini API supports desktop call**, i.e. AI can operate computer software, files, commands, etc.

These are the prototypes for building "AI uses computers " , which are equivalent to an automated combination of GPT-4 + AutoGPT + computer scripts.

# **Android XR smartglasses first public presentation** Google presents the prototype Android XR smartglasses:

- Real-time translation, navigation, mission alert.

- Integration with Gemini, real visual assistant.

- Apple-like Vision Pro, but closer to everyday life and practical scenes.

This marks Google’s movement towards an integrated platform for “AI+ Hardware+Operational Systems.”  Gemini will become the intellectual layer of the real world and will no longer be confined to the screen.
