Black Forest Labs A new generation.**Multi-model image generation and editing models-FLUX.1 Kontext**Multi-model image generation and editing models-FLUX.1 Kontext It's different from the traditional graphic model. Kontext And I understand.**Text and Image**Text and ImageInput ‚ô™ Can make it real ‚ô™‚ÄúAt the end of the day,**Context generation and editing**Context generation and editing
Tradition. **text-to-imageText Generate ImagesI'm not sure what I'm talking about.Model**text-to-imageText Generate ImagesI'm not sure what I'm talking about.Model Like DALL¬∑EStable Diffusion ‚ô™ When it's strong ‚ô™ But there's a lot of limits.-

- Only by word control Unable to combine pictures with context;

- Unable to continuously edit or retain character features Lack‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Cognitive continuity); and

- Local editing requires a complex mask or finetuning;

- It's often a decomposition of images after multiple rotations.Frustration.The style is missing.);

- Edit Slow Unable to meet real-time interactive needsI don't know.

### üîç FLUX.1 Kontext Objective-
‚ô™ Build a real ‚ô™ **‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Context PerceptionI'm not sure what I'm talking about.context-awareI'm not sure what I'm talking about.**‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Context PerceptionI'm not sure what I'm talking about.context-awareI'm not sure what I'm talking about. Image Generation and Edit EnginesI don't know.
Which means...-**You can be like... Photoshop + GPT It's as natural as it is.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Figure+Man.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Control image generation and modification FlexibleEfficient ‚ô™ And keep the character alive ‚ô™Style ConsistencyI don't know.**You can be like...

It's a hit.-

- **The ability to understand the image context**The ability to understand the image contextNot only does it generate images from text I can understand the image and modify it.I'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- **Quick-interactive editing capability**Quick-interactive editing capabilityLow delayStep-by-stepI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

### Kontext What's the bright spot?
**Role coherence**Role coherence-It keeps people or elements consistent in multiple scenarios.
**Local Edit**Local Edit-Edit only specific parts of the image Without prejudice to other regions
**Style References**Style References-Creates a new scene in a specified style
**Quick interaction.**Quick interaction.-Quick ReciprocalThe delay is extremely low.

## Main functions

### üìå 1. Synchronization ControlsText + Image PromptI'm not sure what I'm talking about.
Images can be generated not only from text You can upload images as well.Change it with text.I don't know.

### üéØ 2. Local EditLocal EditingI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- Yeah.**Accurately modify a part of the image**Accurately modify a part of the image It doesn't affect the whole style or any other area.I don't know.

- There's no need for a mask.Layer or image labelingI don't know.

üß† That means...-**You can be like a strategist. Only‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Move where you want to move.**You can be like a strategist. Only‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Move where you want to move.

### üë• 3. Consistency between character and styleCharacter & Style ConsistencyI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- No matter how many different scenes you create, Just give the same reference or description. Models automatically keep people's faces.EmoticonsConsistency.I don't know.

- That's right.It's like moving around.Write.WatercolorI'm not sure what I'm talking about.I can also maintain a unified expression.I don't know.

üß† To build continuous visual contentLike a comic book character.Virtual spokespersonI'm not sure what I'm talking about.Very valuable.I don't know.

### üîÑ 4. Multiple rounds of continuous editingIterative EditingI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- You can add changes to the same graph repeatedly_Other OrganiserLet her laugh first. ‚Üí And sunglasses. ‚Üí We'll change the background. ‚Üí We'll change the clothes and the words.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.

- Each step is based on the previous round.I don't know.

üí°This is the first model system that allows multiple rounds of natural language to drive visual modification.I don't know.

### ‚ö° 5. Quick! Quick!It's interactive.Low Latency InferenceI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- The speed of reasoning is as high as the current mainstream model. 8 Multiply;

- EditingIt's a near-realistic process.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Real-time feedbackI'm not sure what I'm going to do.Fit to user Quick Test Errors and AdjustmentsI don't know.

## They also launched an interactive interface.

### üíª FLUX Playground Introduction-
One for the developer.The originals prepared it. **Graphical interface platform**Graphical interface platform No code or integration required You can use it quickly. FLUX ModelI don't know.
‚úÖ Characteristics-

- Enter text or upload image Real-time experience to generate and modify effects;

- Multiple rounds of editing are available View each step in comparison;

- Prototype and capability demonstration for presentation to clients or decision makers;

## Current restrictions and concerns
BFL It's also an honest list of the current model limits.-

- After several consecutive modifications There's a possible deterioration in the quality of the image.It's like a shadow of color.The details are blurry.);

- In individual cases Model understanding of text deviates from or ignores certain requirements;

- Yeah.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Knowledge of the worldIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.It's a weak understanding.For example, it's possible to draw an unstructured scene.);

- Some of the details may be lost during the model compression distillation.Impact on high-fisibility applicationsI'm sorry, I don't know.
