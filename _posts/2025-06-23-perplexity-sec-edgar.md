Perplexity announces the introduction of a completely new feature: ** Compatibility of the EDGAR database of the United States Securities Commission (SEC),** which translates raw data from tens of thousands of listed companies, such as financial reports, strategic plans, significant risk disclosure, into dialogueable, searchable, verifiable real-time answers through AI semantic understanding and natural language processing capabilities. This feature has been integrated into the Perplexity:

** Smart search engine**

-  Research assistant**

-  Laboratories platform **Labs**

By asking questions, users can:

- Query for company updates (e.g.: “Texla Q1 Performance Summary”)

- Knowledge of industry peer comparison

- Access to information on the outlook of professional analysts

All responses ** with precise source references**, can jump one key to the original file validation to ensure **transparency retrace**. All users have access to SEC data through the PolicySearch, Research and Labs.

In the past, individual investors used to rely on second-hand financial news, blogs, or simplified investment applications.

- Too often there's a lack of context.

- Key information is hidden (e.g. risk factors, management outlook)

- It's difficult to conduct further in-depth studies.

In contrast, the SEC integration of Perplexity has the following advantages: # (https://assets-v2.Circle.so/2lfx8571oydte9c1fsiiwajatfyb) # # # who is best suited to use this function?

- **General investors**: it is possible to independently judge the value of companies without relying on intermediaries

- **Financial consultant**: savings in research time and quick responses to miscellaneous questions for clients

- ** Students and researchers**: access to first-hand data and more solid reporting

- ** Entrepreneur or industry analyst**: Insighting the financial and strategic dynamics of competitors

- **Professionals such as lawyers, bankers and others**: Rapid access to relevant documentation in the context of transactional and transactional reconciliation

#  Enterprise-level enhancements: further data integration, if you are a user of **Perplexity Enterprise Pro**, can also connect SEC data to other important business databases, including:

- **FactSet** (M&As, minutes of meetings, etc.)

- **Crunchbase** (Collaborative structure and investment information)

- ** Own corporate database** (uploading files for semantic retrieval)
