Google announced at its I/O 2025 General Assembly that **Project Starline**, which existed as a research project, had formally evolved into a new 3D video communication platform - **Google Beam**, which built on Google Cloud and advanced AI technology to work towards a more natural, immersed video talk experience.

**What does it do?**Google Beam is a 3D effect that allows remote video calls to look like real face-to-face chatting, using artificial intelligence to capture the 2D image "Change" found on a regular camera.

- ** What are the main functions?** 3D video calls (without equipment)

- Real-time voice translation (retention of tone, expression)

- Natural eye contact and expression.

- Compatibility with enterprise-level workflows

- ** What problem does it solve?** The “dissociation” and language barriers of cross-geographic communication make remote collaboration more like being physically present.

- ** What's it using?** Build a volume video model through AI + optical display technology.

- ** What has been achieved?** A immersion, high level of integrity and humanization of remote communication has been achieved, especially in the context of business teleconferencing, client exchanges, etc.

Initially,**Project Starline** was a front-line research project launched by Google a few years ago, aimed at creating an experience of remote video communication as if it were in its immediate vicinity. Its core objective is:** to break physical space and achieve a sense of face-to-face communication** and not to rely on any additional equipment, such as VR helmets or 3D glasses.

# Core technical capability 1. **AI-driven "Volumetage Video Model"** The core of Google Beam is an advanced AI model capable of automatically reconstructing 3D images with depth and stereo sense from a normal 2D video stream. This means:

- Users can see each other in real proportions, angles, light without wearing any equipment, as if there was a person sitting across the street.

- Support for a more natural and flexible interaction from an arbitrary perspective.

** The Light Field Display displays a real spatial sense** coupled with a video from the AI model, Beam creates a very compelling depth through the optical display technology:

- Real eye communication**, unlike the traditional video, which is “not in line”;

- Capable of capturing and transmitting subtle** facial expressions and physical movements**, which contribute to understanding, building trust and resonance.

3. **AI real-time voice translation: a natural bridge for cross-linguistic communication** Google Beam is integrating ** real-time voice translation** and is currently applied in Google Meet:

- Support for “almost real-time” translations;

- ** Retain original tone, tone and emotional expression**;

- Allowing users of different languages to speak the same language,** maximizing a return to the true feelings of face-to-face dialogue**

This is a crucial step towards realizing Google's vision of “global accessibility communication”.

# Enterprise-level outreach: From laboratory to conference room Google is working with a number of well-known businesses to introduce Google Beam to actual use scenes: 1. ** Device partners: HP first roll-out of Beam hardware**

- HP will show the first Google Beam devices at the InfoComm exhibition in 2025;

- It will be open to selected business clients during the year.

2. **Technology integration and distribution network**

- Google, in collaboration with Zoom, plans to integrate Beam functions into the Zoom platform;

- Working with AVI-SPL, a leading global audio-visual integrator, to promote Beam's landing among corporate clients.

3. ** Lead client pilot business** includes the following globally recognized institutions that have been involved in the pilot or expressed willingness to cooperate:

- **Deloitte** considers Beam to be “the next generation of technology that connects humanity”, not only as a tool, but also as a new concept of connectivity;

- **Salesforce, Citadel, NEC, Duolingo, Recruit** have been deployed internally or have expressed a high level of interest;

- Clients in the medical sector such as **Hackensack Meridian Health** are also exploring their potential in telemedicine.

## The actual application scene and vision Google Beam was originally designed to “** from anywhere to achieve the same communication experience as together**”. Its future application orientation includes but is not limited to:

- Teleconferencing, client visits, staff training;

- Quality interaction between teachers and students in educational scenes;

- In-depth communication between doctors and remote patients in the medical profession;

- It may even extend to online recruitment, cultural exchanges, cross-border business negotiations, etc.
