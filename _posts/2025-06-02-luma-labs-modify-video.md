In traditional video production processes, changing the scene (e.g. from day to night, or from office to fantasy world) often requires reshooting, rewrite, or even change a whole set of tools. Not only is it costly, time-consuming, but it also limits the imagination of the creators.

# The main function is detailed

##1.  Action capture + Driver New Role

- Automatically extracting information from the original video ** all body movements, facial expressions and lip synchronisation**;

- These “action data” can then be used to drive new characters or objects — be they CG characters, props or cameras;

- For example, an actor could be “transferred” to a monster or a table could move along a dance rhythm.





##2. #WorldSwap

- Do not change the person and the movement, but can ** completely change the appearance and material quality of the scene**;

- For example: change the garage to a spaceship;

- Turning the sun into the night vision;

- To transform the carpenter into a film-grade sense of truth;

All changes are based on an understanding of the original structure, avoiding distortion of the image or confusion of time.

##3.  Local element modification (Issolated Edits)

- May ** modify only one element of the video** without destroying other parts;

- For example, changing the dress color of the role;

- Replacing facial features (e.g. changing the face of an actor);

- Adding flying objects to the sky (e.g. UFO);

The key is that:** there is no need for green curtains, no need for framework-by-frame tracking** to modify the natural integration landscape.

# III. Usage and freedom of creation

##** ** Three preset styles** “Modify Video” provides three different preset models that allow users to adapt the creative freedom of the video flexibly to the needs. For example: [https://assets-v2.circle.so/9rshz3lgfan0b28h3j1v71bea2fo)** The model provides minimal modifications based on the original video structure, mainly to the ** style and texture of the scene. For example, you can change the background colour or texture of the video, but the movement, watch and lens angle of the person remains essentially the same. This model is well suited to projects that require restoration or consistency at a later stage, such as the visual style of multiple lenses.** **Flex (flexible model) the model allows for more creative adjustments while preserving the key elements (e.g. the style of the person, or the image of the image of the image, or even the image of the image of the image of the person, can be used as a medium or medium of the idea.

##**The freedom of creation: how to choose the appropriate model** The creator can choose different models to adjust video content depending on the project’s different needs. For those cases where raw material needs to be retained, the **Adhere** model is ideal because it focuses on fine-tuning the original video.

# The advantage over other tools is that, unlike the traditional "tips generate video" or static filters, the key to Modify Video is **time sequence understanding and motion retention**:

- Advanced signals (e.g. postures, emoticons, structures) are used to distinguish between elements that should be retained and those that can be redesigned;

- ** Video-level high-security control**, not just looking at a frame, but understanding the entire footage;

- ** Results of output are more consistent**, especially with regard to face, body movement, time continuity;

- Official tests show that Modify Video is better than Runway 's V2V tool for visual authenticity and action consistency.[] [https://assets-v2.circle.so/0udra1xvnlkugw713tcinmo57c23] [https://assets-v2.circle.so/frdre9bymerfb91mxldyudm668]

# How to use Modify Video has been integrated in **Luma Dream Machine: Ray 2** for video clips of up to **10 seconds. The operating process is very simple: upload a video; select a conversion preset (Adhere / Flex / Reimagine); decide whether to provide a first image or visual style hint; If there is a hint: describe the video changes you want (the more specific the better) Select the “modify intensity”: determine the extent of the image changes The tool automatically generates multiple versions for your quick selection or reprocessing.

- Concept testing (Previs);

- Proposals/synthetic samples;

- Quick-changed final piece delivery.

# # The technique of writing hints (Prompt how to write effects) The effect of Modify Video depends to a large extent on the "descript" you typed, just like you're communicating with an AI group:

- ** To describe it positively and not to use the word “no”**;

- Describe what you want to see, not avoid it;

- Like writing a script or a camera language, the stronger the picture is.

** Example:**

- Change of clothes: "A woman in a blue dress"  AI will automatically change the original person;

- Change of scene: “A Saberbunk street full of neon lights and flying cars”;

- Gat effect: "The purple magic flame spins out of her hand."

- Alternatives: “Place a light sword instead of a stick, bright light”.

# # The advice before you shoot the video #

- The video should be as stable as possible (don't be violent);

- A clean and concise background as best possible (e.g. white walls or open areas);

- The short video is the best (recommendations 5-10 seconds);

- The video's clear and the results are even better.

What's the limit?

- No more than **10 seconds per upload**;

- Differing or low-resolution material effects;

- If there are ** many fast-moving objects in the picture, ** it may not be stable enough;

- It is proposed that long videos be broken into multiple segments.
