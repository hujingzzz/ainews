On Google I/O 2025, the Google Labs team announced the launch of a new generation of UI design generation tools **Stitch**, an upgraded version of the previous Galileo AI acquired by Google. Stitch combines the latest model of Google Deepmind (e.g. Gemini and Imagen) to allow developers and designers to generate, modify, translate, export complete product interfaces and front-end codes through text commands alone.

One sentence creates the full UI.

- Gemini + Imogen Enabling Content and Visual Personalization

-  Multilingual localization key completed

-  Export clean code directly developed

# What do you think Stitch can do?

##1. Generate UI design and product interface (in a single sentence) Stitch is an AI tool ** for text-based UI and product page**:

- Enter a description of the product, which automatically generates a draft interface that conforms to the design specifications

- Support for fast-changing layouts, components, colour schemes

- Modern styles, structures are available, with almost no need for a second modification

##2.  Call Gemini and Imogen for custom updates

- Change the subject style of the App (e.g. from "business blue" to "environmental green")

- Auto-generated texts adapted to different contexts/festivities/user types

Auto-adjusted colour and content  Use Imogen:

- Replacing pictures of products

- Generate appropriate visual material according to context.

Auto-translation of languages and scripts

- Request Gemini to automatically update copies to different languages.

##3. Key export front-end code after completion of design, user can:

- Export high-quality, deployable front-end codes (HTML, CSS, React, etc.)

- To embed design directly into the development process without the need for "hand-reducing UI"

# Stitch's predecessor was Galileo AI

- Stitch is an evolution from **Galileo AI**, a start-up product with a text-generation interface at its core

- **Galileo AI has been officially acquired by Google**

- Founder Arnaud Benard joined Google to create Stitch together with Gemini team![] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/64ybh3a8yovodxemltc0zbz019hv) Visit: https://stitch.withgoogle.com/
