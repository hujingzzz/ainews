The discovery of us.The cause of the error and the deeper analysis of future improvementsI don't know.
4 Month 25 Day We're here. ChatGPT It was on the line once. GPT-4o Update ♪ Make the model ♪“At the end of the day,I'm flattered.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.There's a clear increase in propensity.I don't know.It's not just flattering the user. It'll also verify the user's suspicions.To fuel anger.Invigorate impulsive behavior. Or strengthen negative emotions in an unexpected way.I don't know.Except for the discomfort. Such acts may also pose a security risk.——For example, on mental healthEffects of emotional dependence or high-risk behaviourI don't know.
4 Month 28 Day We're starting to roll back. We should update it. Users are now using the early stages.More balanced version GPT-4oI don't know.Earlier this week. We've already shared this issue.[1]Preliminary information——Why did you make a mistake? And our follow-up plan.I don't know.
We couldn't catch up on this before we got online.I don't know.This paper will explain why.Lessons learned and directions for improvement And add more about modeling training.Technical details of the review and deployment process To help you understand. ChatGPT How to upgrade and the basis for our decision-making.I don't know.

## **How are we here? ChatGPT Updating Models**How are we here? ChatGPT Updating Models
We keep improving. ChatGPT Models in %1 These improvements are called backbones.mainlineI'm not sure what I'm talking about.UpdateI don't know.Since last year 5 Light's in. ChatGPT Launch GPT-4o Since then We've issued five major updates.New window openI'm not sure what I'm talking about.[2] Focusing on model personality and helpI don't know.Every update will be followed by a new training.post-trainingThis is the first time I've ever seen you.And combine a few minor changes from a number of independent tests into an updated model. Let's re-evaluate whether we're online or not.I don't know.
Post-training process-We start with the pre-training base model. A large number of ideal answers written by manual or existing models are used first**Oversight fine-tuning**Oversight fine-tuning This is followed by the use of incentive signals from a variety of sources.**Enhanced learning**Enhanced learningI don't know.
At the intensive learning stage We're providing a hint to the language model. Let it generate a response. Then you score the response according to the reward signal. and update the model Makes them more likely to have a high score response.Reduction of low responseI don't know.
Incentive signals and their weight determine the final model behaviour.I don't know.How to define a suitable incentive signal set is very challenging. We'll take stock.-Is the answer correct?Is it useful?Conformity with model normsNew window openI'm not sure what I'm talking about.[3]Is it safe?Do users like to wait?I don't know.A more comprehensive reward signal can bring a better model. So we keep trying new signals. But every signal has its limits.I don't know.

## **Current pre-deployment review process**Current pre-deployment review process
When you get the candidate model, We'll assess safety through a set of processes.Behaviour and help Presently includes-

- • **Offline evaluation**Offline evaluation-Use Overwrite MathematicsEncodingChat PerformanceAssessment data sets on personality and universal usefulness Proxy indicator of utility to users as modelI don't know.

- • **On-the-spot checks and expert tests**On-the-spot checks and expert tests-Except for the formal evaluation. Internal experts interact heavily with models before they get online. Well, informally, it's called.“At the end of the day,vibe checkThe goal is to feel the actual performance of the model.-Does it seem useful?Respect. & Match Model Spec ValuesI don't know.The executor is familiar. Model Spec The senior model designer. It also contains the ingredients of judgment and taste.——I believe the model is actually in use.“At the end of the day,Feel.

- • **Security assessment**Security assessment-Check whether the model meets the safety baselineI don't know.Such disruptions focus on the immediate harm caused by malicious users. They also test the model's response to high-risk situations, such as suicide or medical treatment.I don't know.We're expanding our hallucinations.Scope of assessment of model misconduct, such as fraud;They're now more used to track overall progress. It's not a direct stop to the line.I don't know.For major new releases We'll be in the open system.New window openI'm not sure what I'm talking about.[4]Description of the safety testI don't know.
• **Front-line risk**Front-line risk-Assessment of potential front-line models for their emergency risks[5]Like cyberattacks.Biological weaponsI'm not sure what I'm talking about.Serious hazard capability.I don't know.

- • **Red team test.**Red team test.-Same for front-line models or introduction of new high-risk product patterns We do internal and external red team tests.New window openI'm not sure what I'm talking about.[6] To verify robustness of known hazards and identify new risksI don't know.

• **Small A/B Test**Small A/B Test-After the security check. Send a new model to a small number of users That's right./Step on it.Parallel observation of polymeric indicators such as preference and use patternsI don't know.

## **4 Month 25 What's wrong with the day-to-day update?**4 Month 25 What's wrong with the day-to-day update?
The updated candidate contains several improvements-Better absorb user feedbackMemory and updating data, etc.I don't know.Preliminary assessment indicates that Take a stand-alone look at each change.“At the end of the day,It's good.I'm not sure what I'm going to do.But when combined, it could lead to an imbalance in flattering tendencies.I don't know.For example... User-based feedback introducedThat's great./Step on it.I'm not sure what I'm talking about.The extra reward signal.I don't know.Usually a pedal means there's a problem. But in general, These changes have weakened the main incentive signal that was used to curb the fading tendencies.I don't know.In particular, user feedback sometimes favours a more responsive response. So it zooms in.I don't know.There's signs. In some cases, user memory exacerbates the problem. Although there is no evidence that their role is widespreadI don't know.

## **Why didn't the jury find out?**Why didn't the jury find out?
Offline evaluation——Especially with behavioral evaluation.——Good overall.;A/B The test also showed that the test user liked the new model.I don't know.Even though it's been discussed internally. GPT-4o It's a risk to me. But it wasn't clearly marked at the time of the test. Because some experts are more concerned with tone and style change.I don't know.There are still testers who indicate model behavior.“At the end of the day,Feel.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Something's wrong.I don't know.
In addition, We don't have a deployment assessment to track A Xiang Xiang Xiang.I don't know.♪ Though I'm here ♪“At the end of the day,Mirror EffectIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.And emotional dependence.[7]There's been research in this direction. Not yet included in the deployment processI don't know.After this rollback, We're going to add the evaluation to the process.I don't know.
We had a choice.-Is it just an expert's subjective warning to stop going online? Quantified assessment and A/B It's all positive.Finally, we chose to go online. It turns out it was a mistake.I don't know.The de-linear evaluation isn't wide enough. I didn't catch Chai's behavior.——And model norms.[8]A clear demand to avoid that.;A/B The test also lacks enough signal to reflect the dimension.I don't know.

## **The measures we've taken**The measures we've taken
This one. GPT-4o Update on 4 Month 24 DayThursday.I'm not sure what I'm talking about.Start step-by-step. 25 Day completedI don't know.We've been monitoring early usage and internal signals for the next two days.I don't know.It's clear on Sunday that model behavior is not in line with expectations.I don't know.
That night, let's update the system to quickly mitigate the negative effects. And roll back completely on Monday. Time-consuming 24 Hours to ensure stabilityAvoiding the introduction of new issuesI don't know.
Now. GPT-4o Back to the old versionI don't know.♪ Since the rollback ♪ We've been digging deep into the problem and developing long-term improvements.I don't know.
