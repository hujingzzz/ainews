Project Mariner is a prototype project launched by Deepmind for the future AI automated workflow, which controls multiple intelligent bodies in virtual browsers through natural languages. ** Core objective** The system is designed to enable users to quickly deploy one or more AI smart agents to perform complex tasks in the browser environment. ** The Mariner name comes from the term “navigate” and symbolizes that AI is able to navigate and perform functions autonomously in the “ocean” of information. ** Job type**

- Information retrieval (search, match, filter)

- Interactive web pages (clicks, forms, scrolling, copying, etc.)

- Data entry and integration (e.g., extracting structured information from multiple pages)

- Multitask schedule (and send multiple windows or tabs)

# System capabilities and working methods

## 1. **Language-driven control** Users use natural language descriptions of tasks, which the system converts to implementable plans. For example: “Please help me find three university websites that offered AI courses in 2023 and collate course names, tuition fees and web links.” The system does not need step-by-step guidance from users, but** has an autonomous understanding of the mission structure and planning of the implementation process**.  (https://assets-v2.circle.so/iiidzbbb2btziubmdr1xu0kp7ajk7). ##2. ** Virtual browser operating environment**

- All task operations are carried out in virtual browsers by simulation of real user behaviour;

- Smart bodies can perform DOM operations such as clicking, input, drag, navigation, submission of forms, etc.;

- The browser runs in the sandbox and supports the task segregation and distribution.

##3. **Multi-task Parallel Scheduler**Project Mariner is able to **Multi-agent concurrent task**:

- Each task runs in the case of an independent browser;

- Control modules to coordinate task implementation sequences, data sharing and progress tracking;

- May dynamically generate, terminate or adjust the conduct of the agent of the mission.

##4 **4. Enhanced learning and task feedback mechanisms**

- The system supports learning from user feedback.

- Introduction of incentive signals and reward mechanisms to optimize mission implementation strategies.
