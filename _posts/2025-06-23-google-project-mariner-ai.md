Project Mariner Yes. DeepMind For the future. AI Prototype project launched by automated workflow It controls multiple smart bodies in natural languages and carries out simultaneous tasks in virtual browsers.I don't know.
✅ **Core objectives**Core objectives
The system is designed to allow users to pass instructions in natural languages. Quick schedule one or more AI Smart Agent Simulate humans to perform complex tasks in the browser environmentI don't know.
Mariner The meaning of the name comes from“At the end of the day,A navigator.I'm not sure what I'm going to do.Symbol AI It's capable of information.“At the end of the day,Oceans and seasIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Central Autonomous Navigation and TaskingI don't know.
✅ **Task Type**Task Type

- Information retrievalSearchThat's right.FilterI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- Web-based interactiveClickForm completedScrollCopy etc.I'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- Data entry and integrationFor example, extracting structured information from multiple pagesI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- Multitask scheduleSend more than one window or tabI'm not sure what I'm talking about.


## System capabilities and modus operandi

### 1. **Language Driver Control**Language Driver Control
Users describe tasks in natural languages The system transforms it into an implementable planI don't know.For example...-
“At the end of the day,Please help me find the three families.2023Provided in the yearAIUniversity website of the course And sort out the title of the course.School fees and official web linksWe're not going to be able to do that."
The system does not require step-by-step guidance from users It's just...**Autonomous understanding of the mission structure and planning of the implementation process**Autonomous understanding of the mission structure and planning of the implementation processI don't know.

### 2. **Virtual Browser Operating Environment**Virtual Browser Operating Environment

- All tasks are performed in virtual browsers by simulation of real user behaviour;

- Intelligent is available. DOM Operation If clickInputDragNavigationSubmit forms, etc.;

- Browser running in sandbox Support task separation and synthesizingI don't know.

### 3. **Multitask parallel scheduling**Multitask parallel scheduling
Project Mariner Yes.**Multiple sub-tasks in parallel**Multiple sub-tasks in parallelmulti-agent concurrent execution:

- Run each task in the stand-alone browser instance;

- Control module coordination of task execution orderData sharing and progress tracking;

- Dynamicly generatedTermination or adjustment of the conduct of the agent of the missionI don't know.


### **4.Enhancing learning and task feedback mechanisms**4.Enhancing learning and task feedback mechanisms

- The system supports learning from user feedbackI don't know.

- Introduction of incentive signals and reward mechanisms to optimize mission implementation strategiesI don't know.

I've got details.-https://deepmind.google/models/project-mariner
