@ArtificialAnlys Published article called DeepSeek The model just released. R1 _Other Organiser R1-0528 It significantly enhanced the model's performance in multiple intellectual evaluations. The score's up. 68 min and Google Gemini 2.5 Pro And it's the second most important thing in the world. After OpenAI SeriesI don't know.
Joined the second largest artificial intelligence lab in the world.I don't know.
This update has not changed the structure. It's about optimizing the reasoning of models by strengthening learning techniques. Let's make it work.Code GenerationThere has been significant progress in a number of capacity indicators, such as scientific reasoning. Shows a lot of after-training excellence.I don't know.At the same time, token The increase in usage also indicates a more detailed response.Consider a more comprehensive approach.I don't know.
Global AI _Other Organiser This marks an open source model that is close to the top level of a closed source in intelligence.I don't know.And more importantly, From China. DeepSeek It's shrinking and it's taking the lead with the United States. AI The gap between the laboratories We've got a lead in some areas.I don't know.
This trend is indicative of Fine-tuned by strategies such as enhanced learning Even if the resources are not as good as they are. OpenAI Under the circumstances, Other AI The lab has a chance to catch up and get close to state-of-the-art intelligence.I don't know.

DeepSeek It's... it's... it's... R1 It's beyond. xAIMeta and Anthropic and Google He's the second largest man in the world. AI Laboratory At the same time, sit on the head of the open-source weight model.I don't know.

**The details of the model upgrades are as follows:-**The details of the model upgrades are as follows:-

- üß† To improve intelligence overall.-Yes. AIME 2024Competing Maths +21 min.LiveCodeBenchCode Generation +15 min.GPQA DiamondScientific reasoning +10 min.Humanitys Last ExamLogic and knowledge +6 minI'm not sure what I'm talking about.This is particularly impressive.I don't know.

- üè† No change in structure-R1-0528 It's a post-training update. Unchanged V3/R1 Structure‚Äî‚Äî‚ô™ Still a possession ‚ô™ 671B Total parameters37B Activate ParametersI'm not sure what I'm talking about.It's a super-large model.I don't know.

**About AI Some of the conclusions-**About AI Some of the conclusions-

- üëê Unprecedented gap between open-source and closed-source models-The open source weight model can still maintain intelligent growth comparable to that of a proprietary model.I don't know.DeepSeek R1 Since January, when we first took the second place in the world, This update is back to the same position again.I don't know.

- üá®üá≥ China and the United States are both technologically competitive.-China AI The model of the lab has almost evened out the U.S. counterparts.I don't know.This release continues this trend again.I don't know.Current DeepSeek Yes. AI You're in the lead on the smart index. Anthropic and MetaI don't know.

- üîÑ Enhanced learning for intellectual advancement-DeepSeek With the same structure and pre-training Training after adoptionEspecially if it's hard to learn.I'm not sure what I'm talking about.Quite a bit more intelligent. It's authenticated. RL The key role in the reasoning modelI don't know.OpenAI Yes. o1 Present. o3 There's been an expansion. 10 Multiply RL Calculate amount And... DeepSeek Shows it's capable of keeping up with the rhythm.I don't know.Compared to pre-training Extension RL Fewer computational requirements More efficient. To the benefit of limited resources AI LaboratoryI don't know.
