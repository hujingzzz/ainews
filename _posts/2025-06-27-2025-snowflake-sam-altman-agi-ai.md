At the Snowflake Summit in 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy, under the auspices of Conviction’s founder, Sarah Guo, had an extensive side-to-side conversation. Together, they explored rapidly developing artificial intelligence patterns and their implications for the current and future of the enterprise.

# I. PROPOSALS FOR ENTERPRISE: What should be done in the context of AI change?**

# # Core point of view:

- ** “Just do it” - Action as soon as possible is essential**

- ** Do not wait for the next generation model**, otherwise the current dividend will be missed.

- Companies with fast succession, low cost of error and learning skills will eventually win.

# # Deep meaning:

- ** The pace of technological evolution is much faster than the pace of adaptation of the enterprise ' s organizational structure** and a slow step will lose competitiveness.

- One of the key competitivenesss of enterprises will be the “**AI landing speed**” rather than the “watch strategy”.

- Unlike the traditional IT strategy, AI has to go ahead in the chaos when the product matures.

# # practical advice:

- Establishment of **AI pilot unit**, beginning with light tasks such as customer service, process automation, search, summary etc.

- Open-testing error, fast-tracking small-scale testing, building organizational experience.

#  II, AI technical maturity: 2024 vs. 2025**

# The status quo:

- Before 2023, big companies were reluctant to use AI for productive tasks.

- Now: the models of ChatGPT and OpenAI are more stable and are used by enterprises on a large scale.

- Moving from the “trigger phase” to the “**core business collaboration phase**”.

# # meaning:

- Business perception has shifted from “AI is a good toy” to “AI is a productivity tool”.

- AI became a controlled partner within the organization.

# #  III. The importance of memory and retrieval: Why is AI getting more and more “know you?”**

# The key point:

- AI no longer relies on “knowledge in model training”, but has ** search** and ** memory** capabilities: **Retrieval** for real-time access to facts, news.

- **Memory:** for personalized interactive and long-term understanding of user needs.

# # # # interactively upgraded: #

- Like human assistants: remember user preferences, habits, history decisions.

- Closer to the "Agent-like" experience, where models can answer your questions more precisely.

#  **IV, the reality and future of the AI proxy system**

- At present it's like a “smart intern” and in the future it's like a “senior engineer”.

- It is expected that next year the proxy system will help enterprises to solve complex problems and even create new knowledge.

# # Current ability:

- Existing agents such as Codex can handle tasks automatically: GitHub operations, code writing, context judgement.

- Capable of handling ** low-level repetitive cognitive work, e.g. automatic customer support, sale of mail, etc.

# The next phase (for the next year) predicts:

- Agents not only carry out tasks but also identify new solutions and generate knowledge**.

- Accompanies the solution of the enterprise's “most critical destructural problems”.

# #

- The role of personnel within the enterprise has shifted towards “allocation of tasks, evaluation of outputs, provision of feedback” and managing AI agents like managing the team of interns.

# #  V, AGI definition of distance from reality: how far are we from it?**

# #  Sam Altman's point of view:

- “**AGI is not a point in time, but a continuous evolution**”.

- If you see ChatGPT today in 2020, people will say, "It's already AGI."

- There is no need for a definition, but more importantly, attention** to a continuous, fast-tracked progress curve**.

Possible criteria for AGI:

- It automatically discovers new scientific principles.

- A significant increase in the rate of human knowledge creation (e.g., four times the rate of scientific progress).

# # # meaning transformation:

- The discussion of “AGI” is actually about “AI's consciousness”, but it is a question of ** philosophical **.

- The real concern is ** what “AI can solve”** and not whether it meets a definition.

#  Sixth and next generation model (Next-gen Modes) breakthrough**

# #

- Future models will achieve ** superb understanding, reasoning** and higher contextual capacity (e.g., millions token).

- The model provides access to tools, databases, systems within and outside the enterprise and integrates knowledge to perform tasks.

- To perform complex tasks of high quality and robustness and to become a true “manifest of minds”.

- Businesses can hand over the most complex issues to AI, such as chip design, drug research and development.

- Models can connect tools, read a great deal of context and “think for a long time”.

# # Example scene:

- Chip Company: let AI design a new chip.

- Biopharmaceuticals: AI Mechanism for the Analysis of New Medicines.

- Enterprises: allow AI to analyse multi-year financial statements and export strategy reports.

#  Seven, how does the future super-calculation resource (1,000x Compute) work?**

# # # Sam Altman's answer:

- ** "Let AI study for itself how to build a stronger AI"**.

- High-calculation resources are used mainly for:

- Execute multiple rounds and try to find the best solution.

- Enabling complex scientific research.

# Sridhar Ramaswamy (Snowflake CEO) adds:

- If there is an unlimited amount of money, it should be invested in the study of such “significant human dilemmas” as the RNA expression.

- Similar to the “Language Model Human Genome Project”.

# # Full Chinese word for word: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Dialogue

##  Introduction ** Moderator** (0:00–1:12): Looking to the future, we know that AI has the potential to change the world — and it can change in a better direction. Generating AI unlocks the capabilities from writing codes to philosophical reasoning. This starts with a “basic model” that allows billions of users to use data that could not otherwise be accessed. They change our rules of the game, and the most profound that drives change is OpenAI.

##Sam Altman started a conversation with Sarah Guo (1:32): I'm Sarah Guo, founder and managing partner of Conviction, and I'm pleased to host today's conversation. Welcome, Sam. **Sam Altman** (1:42): Glad to be here again. I was just backstage saying -- it's almost like a rock concert for data people! **Sarah** (1:46): Haha, yes. You were here two years ago. **Sam** (1:48): Come, but it wasn't so hot!

##The Enterprise AI Strategic Proposal (2025) **Sarah**(54): So let's start here — Sam, what do you suggest to the corporate leaders who want to deploy AI in 2025? **Sam**(2:04): My proposal is: **Drive, don't wait**. Now many people are hesitating, the models are being updated too fast.

## What's changed from last year? **Sarah**(3:36): So what's the difference between what you proposed last year and what I didn't believe in this year?**Sam**(3:40): It's similar for start-up companies.** Last year, if it's for large enterprises,** I would say, "You can try something, but the production environment is not ready"**. But now it's different – our business is growing very fast.** It's really using our products on a large scale** and they tell us, "This is really doing it now! It's doing what I didn't believe." **Sarah**(4:56): So you think it's next year** what we're going to say about doing next year? **Sam**

## On the role of "Memory and Retrieval" **Sarah** (6:02): On "Memory and Retrieval," what role do you think they play in the future of AI? **Sam**(6:16): Like Retrieval technology has always been the key to making the generation AI “land better”. Ask a factual question, for example, if it is not supported by context, the model may be wrong. So as early as the GPT-3 period, we did the web search system to supplement the background needed for answers such as current events. And "Memory" allows the system to know what you've talked to it before, and thus to perform better in the future. These capabilities will become increasingly important in the future, especially when doing more complex tasks.

##Agent capabilities and prospects **Sarah** (7:16): Can you provide a “Agent competency framework” for corporate leaders? What can we do now? **Sam**(7:25): Yes, the programming agent that we've just introduced, Codex, is an example. You can give it a bunch of tasks that will be handled backstage, and it's very smart. It can connect to your GitHub, and it may be able to watch meetings, slacks or internal files in the future. It's like an intern who can work a few hours a day, but ** it's becoming a senior engineer who can work a few days a day.

## What are AGI? How far are we from it? **Sarah**(9:23): You say that Codex makes you feel AGI's proximity? How far do you define AGI now? **Sam**(9:44): If you go back to 2020, when GPT-3 is not published, show the present ChatGPT to those who see it then, ** This is what AGI is.** We're good at keeping up standards. This is great. But I think that AGI is not really that important, different definitions.

## What will the next generation model do? **Sarah**(15:50): How will your ability to master the next generation model change? **Sam**16: It's gonna be amazing in the next year or two. A leap like the GPT-3 to GPT-4 will reappear again. Business can say, "Give you arithmetic, help me design a better chip/treat new diseases." The model will connect tools, understand the business context, make in-depth reasoning, and do it independently. I didn't think it would happen so soon, but ** it's really close now.

##  framework of model capabilities ** Sarah** (17:05): How do you judge whether a model solves a problem? ** Sam** (17:25)? ** My "ideal model" assumes: ** is super small + extrapolated + can handle 100 billion levels of context + connect all tools. ** The model is wrong to use as a database — it is slow, expensive and unreliable. ** The true strength is the ability to reason. ** You can plug in all the context of a person or an enterprise and then let the model use tools to “think and solve the problem”.

##  If you have 1,000 times more money? ** Sarah** (18:24): What would you use if you had 1,000 times more? **Sam** (18:33): Yuan replied: I will use it to study better models and let that better model tell me how to use all of them. Practical answer: You can now put more money into difficult questions to get better results. Although you don't have 1,000 times more money, ** Understanding this and trying it makes sense in itself.** **Snowflake CEO: ** I will invest it in RNA expression.

# #  Final remarks (20:44) **Sarah**: Thank you very much Sridhar, thank you very much Sam, thank you all!
