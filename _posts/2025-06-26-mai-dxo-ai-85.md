Microsoft developed a name called **MAI-DxO**MAI-DxO The system. Jean.AILike a real doctor.**One step at a time.**One step at a time. Including questionsLet's do the check.Results of the analysis Final diagnosis of the cause of the disease It's not just an answer.I don't know.
It simulates multiple doctors working together. Progressive reasoning and accurate diagnosis of complex casesI don't know.It's a combination of different things.AIAdvantages of models Working together to complete diagnostic tasksI don't know.

## üí° What's the big deal?

- **Better.**Better.-It's easier to diagnose complex diseases than doctors. High success rate85%I don't know.

- **It's cheaper.**It's cheaper.-It doesn't just give you a bunch of useless tests. It will.**It's your own cost.**It's your own cost. It's cheaper and more efficient.I don't know.

- **More like a doctor.**More like a doctor.-Not once. It's just...‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Think about it. ‚Üí Questions. ‚Üí Progressive analysis

- **Federation consultations-**Federation consultations-It's actually a lot.AILike...GPTClaudeThese.I'm not sure what I'm talking about.**Grouping up and working.**Grouping up and working. It's like a couple of doctors talking about it. It's very comprehensive.I don't know.

Microsoft lets this.AIGo on.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,ChallengesIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Yeah.304It's a real case in a medical magazine. And it turns out it's the correct diagnosis rate. **85%**85% And the doctors on the average are just... **20%**20%I don't know.It's a big difference.

### üîÆCompared to the doctor. What's the advantage?
