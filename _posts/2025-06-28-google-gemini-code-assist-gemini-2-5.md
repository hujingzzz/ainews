**Gemini Code Assist** is a Google-initiated **AI programming support plugin**, mainly run in Visual Studio Code. It builds on the Goigle's own Gemini Great Language Model (LLM) to provide real-time assistance in the development of codes, including code generation, debugging, test preparation, document reference and infrastructure management functions.[1] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/1r6v04nsdsrsrresk4vg4ky37ka) updates include support for Gemini 2.5, stronger personalization and better contextual management!

- ** Multilingual support**: applies to any mainstream programming language.

- **Multi-Environmentable**: Supports common IDE, Google Cloud services.

- ** Contextal intelligence perception**: Response optimized based on the current status of the code.

- **AI and security parallel**: business version support compliance, privatization context, VPC security access.

- **Flexibility **: support for free probation, promotion as required.

# Upgrade update

# 1.  Integrating the latest **Gemini 2.5 model**

- ** Greater reasoning**: leading in multiple programming task benchmarking tests, LMARENA tops the list.

- ** More intelligent chat experience**: able to handle more complex issues and debugging requests.

- ** Code generation and re-engineering are more reliable**: more accurate when generating functions, templates or structural re-engineering.

- **GitHub Code Review Upgrade**: Pull Request More in-depth analysis and clearer problem identification.

##2.  Support ** Personalized Custom** (1) Custom Commands

- Users can create their own quick commands for repeat tasks (e.g. fast generation components, test codes, etc.).

- It can be configured in the Gemini settings of VS Code or Jet Brains IDE. (2) Project Rules (Rules)

- Allows users to set coding specifications for items, such as "All functions must be matched to generation unit tests. "

- These rules are automatically effective at each generation of the code and maintain project consistency.

##3.

- ** Supports entire folders/workspaces to add context**, with context windows to **1 million tokens**.
