**Qwen V Lo is a unified multi-model large model (Unified Multimodular Model)** capable of understanding images, generating, editing images, and controlling the process flexibly through natural language instructions. It not only “sees” the image content, but also allows for fine modifications or entirely new creations based on understanding to achieve a closed loop from **Visual perception to visual generation**. Currently, it is a preview version, which can be used through Qwen Chat.

# Core competencies

# 1 Precision image understanding and content re-engineering

- Accurate identification of ** type of object, structural characteristics, style** in the image.

- To retain the main structure of the original map and avoid “deformation” or “false” when the image is modified (e.g. changing colour, style migration).

** Example**: User uploads a picture of the car, saying "Change the colour to blue." Traditional models may change the contour or brand recognition failure; Qwen V Lo not only recognizes the model but also retains the body structure of the vehicle, only naturally changing the color.

#2 Image editor under open-language control Qwen VLo supports the free expression of creative intent by users in natural languages, such as:

- "Change this picture to the 19th century painting style."

- "Let the sky be clear."

- "Let the person's background turn into the city's night vision."

These orders do not require a fixed format, the model can be understood flexibly and the modification can be finalized precisely; it can also perform a combination operation, such as:

- Modify the background + style + add object;

- Achieving a variety of uses, such as image style migration, site re-engineering and illustration details.

##3 Multilingual support, cross-language interactive accessibility Qwen V Lo supports ** Chinese, English** and other multilingual command input that allows users to interact directly with the system in their mother tongue and greatly improve their use experience.

##4 Support for perception type tasks (Visual understanding missions) not only generates images, but Qwen V Lo also handles traditional CV (computer visual) tasks: [] (https://assets-v2.Circle.so/smpfv7qb8k4hlzvypt3dadpsh2) functions that enable the model to have the basic ability to “**analyze images as humans**” and can be used for downstream visual tasks. Qwen V Lo produces images not at once, but rather, as in drawing or printing,** in sequence, starting from the top left corner of the image, gradually generating content one at a time, right and down, until the complete picture is completed.

- easier control of detail and overall consistency;

- Supporting long maps, complex layouts;

- Closer to the logic of human drawings.

Simple comprehension: it is ** “understanding drawing”** and not “all generation and repair”.

# Presentation and ability

##  image generation and creation Qwen V Lo can directly generate images and modify them, e.g. by replacing the background, adding the subject, making style migrations, and even completing large changes based on open instructions, including visual perception tasks such as detection and partitioning.

- Supports the input of pure text (e.g., "Draw a lovely wooddog") to generate images

- Support the uploading of pictures and modification (e.g. "Put it on a hat") - edit images

- Use of ** step-by-step generation mechanism** (left to right, top to bottom) to increase the stability of details![] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/l3mf78vo9ym09p7oyykpkvxrnsy) [] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/04lo5hhf7vhharv6pxvvv2s3pxu)

# # # multi-step, complex command response #

- Support multi-operational combinations, such as "Creating Retrostyle, Changing Background, Adding Text", one-time complete.[1] (https://assets-v2.Circle.so/ Mag0x8tfgevxs1ikzr6z2uldbo01)

# Feel and understand the mission #

- Generate visually sensed intermediate results such as detection boxes, partition maps, edge maps; [https://assesss-v2.circle.so/k3m0jtvl99eh4kbizhoqnqg9] - support input understanding and generation of multiple images. (Multicharting functions are not officially online, please look forward to.) [https://assets-v2.circle.so/qsh6qx0o3aj801n9cb7ogy0dvey9]
