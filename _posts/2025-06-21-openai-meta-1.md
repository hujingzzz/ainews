According to various media reports, Meta succeeded in removing three top researchers from Openai, Lucas Beyer, Alexander Kolesnikov and Xiaohua Zhui, to strengthen its superintelligence project. The three fellows previously worked at OpenAI's office in Zurich, Switzerland, and co-founded the office later in 2024. Before joining OpenAI, they worked together with Deep Partnership and Technical Expertise in Google Deepmind.

## ** Background and Meta's recruitment strategy** Mark Zuckerberg has been active in recent years in promoting corporate competitiveness in the area of artificial intelligence, particularly in the development of “super-intelligent” or “general artificial intelligence” (AGI). According to the Wall Street Journal, Zuckerberg personally participated in the recruitment of top global AI talent by email and Whatsapp directly with the target researcher, even with the creation of an internal chat group called “Breathing Party” to coordinate recruitment targets. He also hosted a dinner at his home in Palo Alto and Tahou Lake, California, inviting potential AI talent.

# ** Background of the three fellows**

- **Lucas Beyer** Worked for six and a half years in Google, focusing on a machine learning system that supports multi-model AIs, including scalable AI models that integrate a variety of data patterns, such as text and images. He was involved in the development of cutting-edge visual models during Google Deepmind.

- **Alexander Kolesnikov** also worked in Google for six and a half years as a senior researcher, focusing on visual AI technology. He led a number of visual model trainings between 2018 and 2024, including the most advanced (SOTA) models on ImageNet in 2019, 2020 and 2021. He was also the co-author of the Vision Transformer (ViT) paper, which produced a visual Transformer model, quoted as high as 49,000 times.

- **Xiaohua Zhai**: A Chinese researcher who graduated from Nanjing University and obtained a doctorate in computer science from Beijing University in 2014. He was a senior research scientist and manager at Google Deepmind, leading a multimodel research team in Zurich focusing on multi-model data (e.g. WebLI), open weight models (e.g. SigLIP, PaliGemma) and cultural diversity research. He was also the co-author of ViT ' s paper.

During Google Deepmind’s collaboration, the three fellows jointly developed several front-line visual models, including Vision Transformer (ViT), SigLIP, PaliGemma, etc., which contributed significantly to the field of computer visualization and multi-model AI. They jumped from Google Deepmind to OpenAI in December 2024, and established the OpenAI European Office in Zurich, focusing on multi-model AI research.

###**OpenAI’s response and industry implications** The spokesperson confirmed the departure of the three fellows without providing further details. OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, in a June 17 broadcaster show, revealed that Meta had offered OpenAI employees a contract bonus of up to $100 million to attract its top talent. Otman said that, while Meta’s offer was extremely tempting, the core team of OpenAI had not yet accepted these offers.

##** Meta’s motivation and vision for the future** Meta’s super-intelligence is seen as part of its strategy of “reverse wind swings” in the AI field. Zuckerberg wants to accelerate the “super-intelligent” goal by forming a team of top experts to develop an AI system that transcends humanity in all tasks. At present, AI technology has not yet reached this level, generally at the stage of “weak artificial intelligence” or near “general artificial intelligence” (AGI). Meta’s super-intellectual team has focused on areas such as multi-model AI, computer visual and large-scale model training, while Bayer, Kolesnikov, and Chang Xiaohua’s involvement has injected critical expertise and teamwork.

##** The industry background and competition for talent** The A.A. talent struggles have intensified in recent years, especially in such frontier areas as computer visualization, natural language processing, and multi-model AI. The event also triggered a discussion on the ethics and resource allocation of the AI industry. Some industry activists are concerned that large pay and due diligence can lead to over-concentration of resources in a few technological giants, limiting the innovation capacity of small and medium-sized research institutions and start-ups.
