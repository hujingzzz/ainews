Anthropic published the Fourth Generation Series of the Claude Model: **Claude Opus 4** and **Claude Sonnet 4**, not only a systematic evolution of the original model, but also of the future AI application landscape. Whether it is code generation, complex reasoning, long-term task processing, or intelligent proxy construction, they show significant advantages. [https://assets-v2.circle.so/smc6wiuchffffw9wbjcd4qb9nky] At the launch of Claude 4, Anthony Mike Krieger elaborated on three major capabilities at the bottom **Agent**:

- **Contextual Intelligence**: no longer simple command execution, but understanding why and how. Your 100th mission with Agent should be much better than the 1st, like the 100th day of the new employee; Claude 4 shows the greatness of this ability. In the tests, it will proactively create a "rememory file" to save key information. When playing with Pokemon, it will even write navigation notes: "Try five times and stay stuck; if stuck, try the opposite direction; go to the other side of the room when the indoor navigation takes place." This autonomous learning and knowledge accumulation is the core value of the human workforce.

- **Long-runing Exchange**: Addressing complex tasks that take hours or even days to coordinate other Agents and humans. This is not only a matter of durability, but also the ability to maintain unity of purpose and consistency in context;

- ** Genuine Collaboration: ** Transparent reasoning process, adapted to human work style. The key is the balance between "intelligent autonomy" and "human supervision" -- AI deals with a lot of detail, humans take control of the big picture.

# Introduction to the core model

# Claude Opus 4 #

- ** Principal: Professional-level programming capacity, continuing mission performance**

- Lead in two authoritative code benchmarking tests: SWE-bench score: 72.5%

- Terminal-bench score: 43.2%

** Could run for several hours, handle hundreds of steps of reasoning**, especially suitable for AI proxy tasks and long-cycle R & D scenarios. Applying feedback (real user validation):

- Cursor: Considered to be "a major leap in the ability to understand the code".

- Replit: Multi-file code changes are more precise.

- Block: “A significant increase in quality and stability in code editing and debugging”.

- Rakuten: its agents operate independently for seven hours and have a stable performance.

- Cognition: Successfully responding to complex decision-making that the models of the past could not handle.

## Claude Sonnet 4 -- Balanced and efficient universal model

- **Standing: high performance and efficiency in routine tasks**

- SWE-bench received a score of 72.7 per cent, slightly higher than Opus 4, and was particularly good at code automation and rational reasoning.

- Although the overall performance is not as high as Opus 4, it is more efficient and responsive as it is appropriate for embedded or immediate response tasks.

Apply feedback:

- GitHub Copilot: Sonet 4 will be the new engine and will be deployed to the new version of the smart programming assistant.

- iGent: for multifunctional autonomous development tasks, code navigation error is almost zero.

- Sourcegraph: The Sonnet 4 is considered to have enhanced code quality and mission continuity.

# New feature bright spot

- ** Supports “tools use + long-term thinking”** (beta version): Models can call tools such as search for alternate reasoning and improve the quality of responses.

- Support for parallel use of multiple tools for efficiency enhancement![] (https://assets-v2.Circle.so/ qainuoaf7u80fusjdzoov3ckdknv) **Remographical capacity significantly improved**:

- “Long-term memory” can be created by accessing local documents, extracting and retaining key facts

Example: Opus 4 will automatically write notes to record the strategy while playing the treasure dream. These are real notes generated by the model itself.[] [https://assets-v2.Circle.so/vjxz5oi0kly7t8sn4smsogzu1b3]**

- Models can create “rememory files” for the storage of mission-critical data.

- Be of particular excellence in the application of AI proxy assignments, allowing for contextual consistency in successive sessions.

** Mandate simplification and controlled thinking presentation**

- Introduction of a "thinking digestor" to refine the reasoning chain over a long period of time, using only about 5% of the cases.

- Developers can apply for "Developer Mode" to see the full reasoning trail for advanced prompt debugging.

# Performance versus actual validation  Baseline test ahead**

- Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 are at the top of the SWE-Bench Verified.

- Opus 4 performed excellently in a number of long, multi-round reasoning benchmarks, significantly exceeding Claude 3.7.

- Sonnet 4 is slightly less than Opus 4, but much more stable and precise than 3.7.[] [https://assets-v2.circle.so/eejtkcv3pr3nr7hbnsh90bshynt] ** User feedback validation**

- **Cursor**: state-of-the-art code model, deep understanding of large code repositories.

- **Replit**: The accuracy and consistency of multiple document changes have increased significantly.

- **GitHub Copilot**: Sonnet 4 will be used to drive its new generation of code agents.

- **iGent/Sourcegraph**: Multifunctional autonomous development, error rate close to 0, code quality improvement is significant.

#Anthropic API Launch AI Agent Building New Capabilities Anthropic Officially released four new features developed for AI Smart Agent (agent) in its API. These features have entered the public beta phase, working with Claude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 models to significantly enhance developers' ability, efficiency and flexibility to build smart agents. [https://assets-v2.circle.so/qj9brzepevqjqjvomxyy5** Code implementation tool: running and debugging the code at the API level. **MCP connector: connecting to multi-component workflows or external services.** Document API**: achieving Claude with data from external filesystems.so/qj9brzevqjxxy5**

- Run Python in the sandbox environment to generate visualized graphs and analyses.

- Possible: Financial modelling (e.g. portfolio analysis, forecasting)

- Scientific calculations (e.g. simulation and experimental data processing)

- Business intelligence (e.g. sales analysis, automatic report generation)

- Document processing (format conversion, data extraction, report generation)

- Statistical analysis (e.g. regression, hypothetical testing, predictive models)

** Use policy**: 50 hours per day free of charge, exceeding the portion charged at $0.05/hour/container. 2 **MCP connector (Model Context Protocol Contractor)** This function streamlines Claude's connection to the external system, leaving developers without the need for manual preparation of client code.

- Support the connection to any remote MCP services such as Zapier, Asana etc.

- Automatically handle the following tasks: connection management, tool discovery, authentication and bug processing

- Smart call remote, automatically determines the call order and parameters

** Example: Build a project management agent to read tasks in Asana, assign tasks, and perform data analysis in conjunction with code implementation.  (https://assets-v2.circle.so/z0j0v5pp76fucf9mrglb7ha2up)  Develop efficiency without manual integration API. ** Document API (Files API)** This capacity addresses the efficiency of handling a large number of documents in multiple rounds of dialogue.

- Support for one upload, multiple references: The same file is not required for each round and is suitable for scenarios such as the knowledge base, technical documentation, structured data, etc.

Files can be accessed directly by the code execution tool:

- For example, uploading a CSV data set to analyse, generate charts, generate summaries, etc. on a sustainable basis over multiple tasks.

Reduce the costs of duplicate uploading and contextual build-up. 4 **Prompt Extension Cache** Optimize the performance and costs of long-term tasks or rich interactions in context:

- The original cache TTL (time of survival) is 5 minutes and now provides **1 hour** extension options.

- Bring: **Maximum 90% Cost Decline**

- ** Up to 85% Delay Reduction**

The scenes include:

- Multiple rounds of work stream.

- Phased analysis or coordination tasks

- Proxy with complete context for intersession

Fits well for enterprise-level Agent applications that need to maintain contextual consistency.

# Security and transparency of thinking

- Models have reduced 65 per cent of "shortcut" behavior in complex missions.

- Introduction of a “thinking summing up function” to summarize only about 5 per cent of the tasks, with a clearer reasoning trajectory.

- Provide Developmenter Mode to support the advanced tip project.
