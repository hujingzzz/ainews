Deepmind Launch a new generation. Gemini Robotics On-Device Robot.AIModel It's okay.**Run independently on the robot's body.**Run independently on the robot's body. Do not rely on cloud-based computing resourcesI don't know.The model integrates vision.Language comprehension and mobility in decision-making It's capable of performing a highly intelligent and variable task.I don't know.
âœ… **It addresses the core issues.-**It addresses the core issues.-

- **Reduced reliance on cloud computing**Reduced reliance on cloud computing â†’ Lower delay Increase response speedI don't know.

- **Operation in an unstable network environment**Operation in an unstable network environment â†’ Increased reliabilityI don't know.

- **Achieving universal operating capability and fast-track adaptation to new tasks**Achieving universal operating capability and fast-track adaptation to new tasks â†’ Enhancing robotic interoperabilityI don't know.

## Technical characteristics
ðŸ“Œ 1. Optimizing local deployment

- The model's done.**Calculate resource compression optimization**Calculate resource compression optimization It allows it to run on robotic devices with limited computing power.I don't know.

- I don't need it. GPU Servers CPU or smallAIChips can also support reasoning.I don't know.

ðŸ“Œ 2. Multi-module integration capability

- Based on DeepMind It's... it's... it's... Gemini 2.0 Model structure It's a collection of visuals.Language and behavioural controlI don't know.

- Availability**Image Perception + Command understanding. + Action execution**Image Perception + Command understanding. + Action executionCapacity for integrationI don't know.

ðŸ“Œ 3. Few-shot Fine-tuning mechanisms

- Support very few samplesOnly50~100Bar PresentationI'm not sure what I'm talking about.I'm going to finish the new job. This significantly reduces the threshold for development and deploymentI don't know.

### How did it go?
âœ… In more than one test. Performance better than existing models-

- **Higher mission completion rate**Higher mission completion rate-Especially when you've never seen a mission before or in a new environment. Models show a much greater ability to generalize.I don't know.

- **Command is followed.-**Command is followed.-Better than other local alternatives in more challenging out-of-post tasks and complex multistep directivesI don't know.

- **The response is faster.**The response is faster.-To benefit from local operations Do not wait for the cloud to return the resultI don't know.

- **More stable implementation**More stable implementation-And a high degree of consistency can be maintained on different robotic platforms.I don't know.

### Fitness-It's not just running. And crosses the platform.

- Yes. ALOHA After Platform training Move to-
**Franka FR3 A robot with arms.**Franka FR3 A robot with arms.-Completion of industrial level assembly tasksI don't know.

- **Apollo It's a human robot.**Apollo It's a human robot.-In the family./Operation of natural language in service-type environmentsI don't know.

ðŸ‘‰ It's worth noting.-This cross-platform migration**There is no need to retrain the model.**There is no need to retrain the model. Just a slight adjustment. You can use the same intelligence.I don't know.

It's meant to be, like,-

- âœ… **Marginal intelligence penetration**Marginal intelligence penetration-Robots can think on their own.Implementation of the mandate No longer dependent on external serversI don't know.

- âœ… **Lower deployment costs**Lower deployment costs-Adaptive. + Quick Fine-tuning â†’ Lower industry application thresholdI don't know.

- âœ… **Cross-hardware unified model architecture**Cross-hardware unified model architecture-In the future, a robotic device with models of various forms can be achieved.I don't know.
