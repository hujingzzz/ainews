Google announces that its **Gemini 2.0 Flash image generation function is now open in the preview phase** and that developers can create and edit images using models such as Google AI Studio and Vertex AI using Gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-development.

#Gemini 2.0 Flash image generation upgrade content:

- ** Higher visual quality** (compared to previous experimental version)

- ** More precise text rendering**

- ** Fewer content filter interception rates** (more accessible) [] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/pn39r5q0r04rq58126n5odas5cv4)

## ** A number of cases ** ** Some examples of the change of the background of the product** For example, you would like to show a water cup, and AI would automatically produce a suitable picture.[!] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/x78gmtxtjayokp79eysg1id14c)**

#  Developer's image generation function: ** Reconstructed **: Place the product in a different environment. ** Real-time co-editorial image**: for example, with Co-Drawing App and Gemini. ** Local image editor**: modify only one part of the image, other areas remain unchanged. ** Dynamic production product SKU image**: create a new image of the product in conjunction with text. ** Creative aid**: co-construct with Gemini, design product image. ** Example code (recruited with Gemini image): ** Developer can use Google API (Python code): from google port genai from google.genai import types class = genai.Clipent = your API key key)
