OpenAI Four major updates were issued Upgraded the building. AI Proxy Especially the ability of voice agents.I don't know.Now. Developer can use it. TypeScript Preparation Agents SDK It also supports human approval mechanisms. Increased control and securityI don't know.Newly Launched RealtimeAgent Allow voice agent to run easily on client or service Advanced audio processing capabilityI don't know.
Traces The dashboard has been upgraded. Support Realtime API Audio Interactive Visualisation Facilitation of debugging and analysisI don't know.speech-to-speech The model was significantly optimized. I've improved command compliance.Tool Call Accuracy And we can adjust the speed of voice broadcast.I don't know.
