OpenAI announced its advanced voice Advanced Voice functionality upgrade, significantly increasing the naturality and fluidity of voice interaction, and making conversation between users and ChatGPT easier, allowing users to communicate with the models as if they were real people. More importantly, the updated version enhances voice translation. Users can engage in multiple rounds of conversation with ChatGPT directly by voice, and the model can be translated continuously without repeated hints until the user explicitly gives a stop. This means that ChatGPT now has better up-to-face capability in voice processing, especially for travel, international commerce, language learning, etc. The update is open to all payees.

- ** The tone is more natural**: AI is no longer speaking in plain words, but with ups and downs, with emphasis.

- ** Rhythm is more real**: A natural pause** and ** accent treatment** was included in the speech, which doesn't sound like a robot.

- ** More emotional expression**: e.g., you can hear ** Empathy**, e.g., "I understand how you feel" is no longer mechanical.

**Sarcasm**, such as “Of course, it's your best idea” has changed dramatically.

# ** Instant voice translation**

- ChatGPT can now act as a “bilingual translator” in voice conversations** for example: you speak English and it is translated immediately into Portuguese.

- He speaks Portuguese, he translates back to you in English.

** There is no need to repeat the opening**, it can be translated continuously until you say “stop translating.” The applicable scenarios include:** international travel, telecommuting, multilingual collaboration**

# ** Method of use**

- This feature has been rolled out to all platforms** (Web, iOS, Android, desktop).

- Click " Voice icon " to start in the dialogue input area.

- The system will enable the latest version of the voice engine to automatically support language recognition and translation.

# # Known limits

- Certain voice options may result in a slight decline in sound** and occasional instability in tone/speak speed.

- ** In very few cases** speech patterns may be “phantomized” to produce unanticipated content, such as background music, murmurs or ads.

- Officially, these anomalies are being continuously repaired to improve consistency and user experience.
