Faced with a rapidly changing creative tool ecology, Google announced in 2025 a new generation of creative media models and tools covering multiple dimensions of video, image, music, and content traceability. Google launched **Flow** – the most advanced AI model (including Veo, Imagen and Gemini) driven by ideas to film-level images **, which helps creators to generate film segments in natural languages without the need for super-effects or animation technology. It is not just another video production tool, but rather a complete creation system created by film creators, dedicated to narratives and the film industry. The launch of Flow means that the transformation of ideas from film-level images will be faster, freer and more efficient than ever before. It is not only a “image generation” but it will be able to produce film segments in natural languages, the language of the lens, and the continuity of visual styles**, which constitute the essence of the AI video production tool.

## Behind three AI engines: Synergy-driven creative processes![] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/zoyb4vh5btje8htfxh4qmps7rikf) These models form a synergic network that allows Flow to achieve the following core competencies:

- Generate roles and scenes with text descriptions;

- Support for the consistency of roles in different lenses;

- Controlling the movement of the camera, the light and the perspective;

- A continuous transition between scenes, supporting the concept of “cut-off”;

- Multiple generation of content can be integrated into a complete short film structure.

A seamless transition, camera control, cinema level quality.

# Critical function: Not just to generate, but to direct the toolbox Flow provides not only image and video generation, but also a large number of functional modules for creative production processes:

##1. **Camera Controls** Allows users to manually specify the angles, tracks and modes of motion of the lens, such as “near-viewing mirrors”, “slow-crossing”, etc., to achieve the language of the film with a sense of direction.

##2. **SceneBuilder** can expand the existing lens or create a natural transition between the scenes, such as revealing more information, changing perspectives, etc.

##3. **Asset Management (Asset Management)** centralizes the generation of “ingredients” (roles, background, objects) and can be reused to maintain a uniform style.

##4. **Flow TV (Case Learning Platform)** The platform has incorporated a large number of short film-based productions with detailed instructions and production methods to facilitate learning and imitation.

##** The **Flow case shows ** Many forward-thinking directors and artists were invited to work with artists in the development of the Flow, three of them:  Dave Clark award-winning director, representing the multi-field creators of Battalion NinjaPunk, who tried to integrate AI technology, and his new film Freelancers, which was completed with the help of Flow and other AI tools to tell about the growth and adventure of separated brothers.  Henry Daubrez digital artist, who used the Flow to produce a new film, Electric Pink, to continue his exploration of isolation and emotional connection. Juniie Lau, a multi-field creator, who is producing a book called "Dear Strangler" – a poem about grandmother and granddaughter crossing multiple parallel universes, with a focus on digital identity and emotional outreach.

#Veo 3 Launching Veo 2 Capability Update Google Deepmind officially publishes its most advanced video production model to date - **Veo 3**. Compared to the previous generation of Veo 2, Veo 3 not only achieved qualitative leaps in image quality, physical consistency, reference compliance, etc., but also introduced new creative dimensions, including audio, to mark the entry of production video technology into the era of film-grade creation.

#Veo 3eo 3 Core Capability 1.4K** High Quality Output and Realization**

- Support **origin 4K resolution output** to achieve visual details of approximating professional cameras;

- A high level of authenticity of the rules of the real world has been achieved in terms of exercise physics, light logic, material quality and so on;

- Significant improvements in object consistency and visual accuracy between scenes, which generate images that are seamlessly embedded in real footage.

2. ** Stronger hint understanding**

- A significant increase in the number of applications in comparison to Veo 2, Veo 3**prompt compliance**;

- Support for more complex descriptions of natural languages, including shot motion, emotional tone, drawing details;

- Allowing users to express their professional director's instructions in popular language (e.g., “in the morning, seaside, hand-held camera, faded light”);

3. **Creation control upgrade**

- Support for coherent action transitions between lenses**, with roles aligned with background logic;

- The ability to construct complex scenario structures (e.g. multi-person interaction, dynamic narrative rhythm);

- Integration ** Audio Generation function** (Veo 3 unique), introducing for the first time into a video model the ability to produce audio ** such as “environmental sound, dialogue” ** to support the generation of environmental sound and dialogue and to match different scenes with emotional atmospheres;



#Veo2 Capabilities Update (as compared to the first edition) has been upgraded despite the shift in focus to Veo 3, Veo 2, particularly in the following areas:

- The introduction of a new Control Module (Control Modeles), which allows users to exercise more precise control over the style and detail of the content generated;

- Improved scene consistency and the quality of long-time sequence lenses;

- Keeping the role consistent: by providing role reference images for Veo, ensure that the role remains visible in the different scenes of the video.

- Better integration with platforms (e.g.,low) for operational creative processes.

##Veo is now integrated into Google Labs' **Flow platform** serving the role of filmman, creative team, advertising producer, etc.

- ** Short film preview and shot planning** (Storyboarding & Previsualization);

- ** Virtual setup and role action simulation**;

- **The production of the concept film**;

- ** Interactive narrative video generation (e.g. game scene animation)**

# Imogen 4: New peak in speed and quality of image generation** ** keyword: 2K resolution + multi style + layout capability increase**

- ** Image mass**: significantly higher than Imagen 3 to produce precise details such as droplets, animal hair, fabric texture, etc.;

- ** Style diversity**: support for realism versus abstract style, different width ratio (print fit, social media, demonstration);

- ** Text layout enhancement**: for the first time, “Scryption and layout” has been enhanced and is suitable for visual writing in words such as cards, posters, cartoons, etc.;

- ** Use of platforms**: Gemini App, Whisk, Workspace (Docs, Slides, Vids) and Vertex AI;

- ** To be launched**: Imogen 4 flash, generating 10 times the rate of Imagen 3 ![] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/mv0pugh5kp4dz2vjnctvlyfc8z) [] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/xgisuk7nhixyt803t3532bcm6][https://assets-v2.circle.so/ii3hfw9e1 elr2h3k1rl0q68ueo] [https://assets-v2.circle.so/buhal37tsv9wbnqq6nlgbn)

#  ** Lyria 2: Real-time music generation and control** ** Lyria 2** is the most recent release of Google Deepmind ** Music generation model** with the objective of generating ** high-security, professional-level audio**, covering a variety of musical styles, structured music songs and creative tool applications.
