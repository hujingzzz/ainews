OpenAI announced that its organizational structure would change significantly: **OpenAI for-profit LLC**, controlled by a non-profit organization, would be transformed into **Public Benefit Corporation, PBC**. This structure is intended to **, while maintaining mission orientation, to introduce more flexible capital structures and resource support** to better advance its core mission - ** to ensure that AGI (general artificial intelligence) benefits all humanity**. ** The new architecture highlights are as follows: **

- ** Non-profit organizations continue to have absolute control** and to be the main shareholders in PBC;

- The need for the PBC to balance public interest and corporate mission with profitability;

- To abandon the old “capture profit model” (apped-profit) and replace it with a regular equity structure;

- Access to greater financing capacity to support global computing resources and modelling training;

- Continuous focus on the development of AI security, democratization applications and open-source models.

Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO) stressed in his staff letter that OpenAI was never a “normal company” whose mission was not to maximize profits, but to maximize the positive impact on human beings. AGI should not serve only a few, but should empower everyone.  AGI’s vision has shifted from a “mysterious tool” to a “human tool”:

- Early fears that AGI was too powerful to be controlled by a small number of “trustworthys”;

- Now, OpenAI's vision is to turn AI into a “human tool” for real scenarios such as scientific research, medical advice, productivity enhancement, etc.;

- The concept of “AGI** for democratization” is the direction that OpenAI continues to follow.

ChhatGPT has shown direct influence:

- Extensive use in learning, science, writing, program development, etc.;

- User demand is far greater than the current supply and AI calculates resource costs to be extremely high;

- OpenAI wants to expand its service capacity to meet “globalization needs”.

• Three core objectives drive the restructuring: ** Sustainability and financing**: access to hundreds of billions of dollars for the training and deployment of a stronger AI (which may reach trillion levels in the future); ** Mission expansion**: making non-profit organizations the most influential public benefit agency in history; ** Promoting security, alignment, democratic AI development**: upholding values, opposing autocratic AI, continuously promoting mechanisms such as Red Brigade testing, model transparency, etc. Sam Altman also promised: “We want to open up some powerful models.”

# Why “change architecture? OpenAI was originally initiated by a non-profit organization with the aim of** ensuring that universal artificial intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity**, rather than being monopolized by a few or businesses. In 2019, OpenAI created a “limited profit company” (LLC) structure to raise funds in response to the enormous computing and financial pressures required for model training.** Today, in the face of greater demands for arithmetic, pressure for commercialization, and for the advancement of the AI’s democratization mission, OpenAI decided to upgrade the structure again:** to transform a profit entity under the flag from a limited liability company (LLC) to a public interest company (Public Benefit Corporation, short of PBC),** a new business structure that requires consideration of both public and shareholder interests.

# Why is the PBC model important? **PBC = Profit + Mission ** This is a business model that balances capital efficiency with ethics and has been adopted by several leading AI companies (e.g. Anthropic, xAI). The benefits it can bring include:

- Financing as traditional companies;

- The long-term impact on society and the public must also be continuously considered in operations;

- Non-profit organizations can act as “gatekeepers” to prevent AI from departing from its original mission.

# The key elements of the restructuring # the non-profit organization still has "control"

- OpenAI ' s non-profit organization will remain** under full control** of the new PBC;

- and will be its ** largest shareholder**, ensuring that mission orientation is not influenced by market interests;

- The decision was the result of consultations with the Attorney General ' s Offices of California and Delaware.

Structure changed from a “profit cap” to a “standard equity model”

- Past LLC use capped-profit to avoid excessive returns to investors;

- Standard equity structures will now be used to increase ownership in order to introduce funds more effectively;

- Sam Altman stressed: “This is not a sale of companies, but a simplified structure.”

• The PBC will act as a profit-making entity, contributing to the realization of the mission

- More sustainable and scaled-up financing capacity (for training models, deployment of products);

- The profits will be returned to non-profit organizations in support of social missions such as global public services, education, scientific research, etc.

## 📝 Sam Altman 致员工与利益相关者的公开信全文（中文翻译）
**OpenAI 不是一家普通的公司，也永远不会是。**
我们的使命是：**确保通用人工智能（AGI）造福全人类**。
当我们创办 OpenAI 时，并没有一套详细的蓝图来实现这个目标。最初，我们围坐在厨房的桌子旁，讨论要做什么样的研究。那个时候我们从未设想过产品、商业模式，更不可能想象 AI 被应用于医疗咨询、学习、生产力提升等等。我们也没有意识到要训练和部署这些模型需要几千亿甚至上万亿美元的算力和资金。
我们其实并不清楚 AGI 会如何被构建、如何被使用。当时很多人幻想着 AGI 是一种“神谕工具”，能为科学家、总统等极少数人提供建议。尽管这种力量可能极具危险性，但人们认为只要掌握在少数可信任的人手里，就可以控制。
在 OpenAI 的早期，确实有不少人认为 AI 只应掌握在一小撮“能驾驭它”的人手中。
但现在，我们看到了另一种可能性：**AGI 将成为人类历史上最强大的工具，直接赋能每一个人。**
如果我们能做到这一点，我们相信人们将用这些工具彼此赋能、创造令人惊叹的事物，推动社会进步和生活质量提升。当然，AI 不可能只被用于善意的目的，但我们相信：**善的力量将远远超过恶**。
我们坚定地走在“民主化 AI”这条道路上。我们想把这些非凡的工具交到每个人手中。我们为用户正在用它们创造的成果感到惊喜和骄傲。**我们希望开源一些能力极强的模型**；我们希望在合法合理的范围内，赋予用户更多自由去决定如何使用 ChatGPT，即便他们的道德框架未必与我们一致。
我们相信，这是最好的前进方向：**AGI 应该赋能所有人来彼此造福**。当然我们知道，并非所有人都认同这一观点。
**我们希望构建一个“世界之脑”，让每个人都能以最简单的方式使用它来做任何事情（只要不侵犯他人自由）。**
人们正在用 ChatGPT 提升科研、写代码、学习知识、应对生活中的难题。看到我们的服务已为如此多的人带来正向价值，这是对我们使命最直接的体现。
但用户的需求远远超出我们的当前供给。我们不得不设置使用限制、系统运行缓慢。随着系统能力提升，人们会用它做更多、更美好的事情，我们需要结构上做出改变，以支持这一趋势。

# # We now think that it is time to restructure. ** We have three objectives: ** to secure and useful AGI** ** to keep our services truly “open” to all. ** This now takes hundreds of billions of dollars, possibly even trillions. ** We believe that this is the way to achieve our most powerful mission. ** to build the most effective and influential AI not-for-profit institution** ** ** to focus on highly leveraged societies that are impacting: education, health, public services, etc. ** ** to achieve security and useful AGI** ** ** We will continue to work in the direction of security and alignment: Général testing, model normative document (model spec), transparency of our system. ** We believe that the democratization of the United Nations must prevail over AI. ** We insist on maintaining control over the non-profit organization.
