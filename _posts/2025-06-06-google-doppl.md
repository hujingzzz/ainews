Google Labs has launched a new application called **Doppl**, designed to help users to upload photos or screens, virtual dress-testing, and better explore and express their personal style. You just take a picture, or a screenshot of a dress you saw in the social media, upload it to Dopl, and it automatically “wear” this dress to you in an animated version, and even move, as you walk in front of the mirror, looking at the effects of the top of the dress.

- ** Try any clothes**: See what you like, take a picture or a screenshot.

- ** Generate dynamic video**: not just photos, but also wear effects like short videos.

- ** Supports conservation and sharing**: Satisfactory models can be saved directly or sent to friends.

- ** Currently available only in the United States**, supporting iOS and Android.

##Doppl What can you do?**According to the social media, **: Doppl not only displays static images, but also finds someone's clothes in the street, so you can upload them to Doppl as long as you take a picture or a screenshot.[!] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/4tjlf3vvqk77u07immaxg452so6a)** It produces animated effects: Doppl not only displays static images, but also uses AI technology to make short videos that allow you to see the dynamic nature of clothes as they move in your body, e.g. clothing, overall layout changes, etc.) [https://assets-v2.circle.so/qub5idplgx6s] It's #4x2x4x2xs of #4x4x4x4xs.

- ** Unlimited brands or platforms**: photos of clothing from any source can be tested and are no longer limited to the electric platform itself.

- ** From static images to dynamic representation**: AI will generate animated versions of you, making the test clothes more real.

- ** Emphasis on style exploration and personal expression**: Not only does it serve to “buy clothes”, but it guides users to what they like and what they fit.

Doppler is still in the experimental phase, so there are some limitations:

- ** Limited degree of authenticity**: Sometimes the material, layout or colours of the clothes are not necessarily and actually matched, especially in light, colour, and physical postures that are more complex.

- ** Data privacy**: Although not specified, uploading personal photographs for AI model analysis and generation may involve a number of privacy issues, in particular the use of face and body images.

- **Regular restrictions**: Currently only in the United States and not yet in other countries.

**  Type not currently supported**

- Shoes, lingerie, swimsuits, accessories.

- Complex or culturally sensitive clothing such as religious or traditional ethnic dress, role-playing clothing, etc.

- Visual dress or clothing that violates the AI content policy

- Doppler will automatically fill the missing parts, like you uploaded the top, and it may automatically add pants and shoes to make a complete shape.

# What scenes can it use?

- ** pre-shopping match certification**: reduced likelihood of return due to inappropriateness.

- ** Get in touch with inspiration**: Makes users dare to try more different styles and quickly judge what suits themselves.

- ** Content creation or fashion sharing**: For content creators, dress effects can be shown more efficiently.

- **Auxiliary decision-making**: Dates, photographs, travels can be selected using Doppl's first set of models.

Dopl (https://assets-v2.Circle.so/4f0as19nyxocfffff35vsi1bnva9b) is now online on iOS and Android platforms in the United States.
