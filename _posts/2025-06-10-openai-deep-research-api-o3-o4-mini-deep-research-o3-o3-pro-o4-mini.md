Deep Research API is an advanced API interface provided by OpenAI to support complex tasks ** Automation, structuralization and real information-based research missions**:

- Resoning;

- Planning;

- Synthesis;

- Real-time search and data processing (WebSearch + Code Interpreter);

- Citation of labels and transparent sources (Citation-Backed Reports);

- Multiple-step mission tracking;

It is a “Agentic Research Pipeline” that provides far more research control than ChatGPT.[1] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/cbn4lqh4wotyraksqz4xptvq6wtk) OpenAI has also launched two API models specifically designed for in-depth research missions

- **o3-deep-research (06-25)**: based on o3 models, applicable to tasks requiring in-depth analysis and high-quality output, at a slower pace. Pricing is $10 per million input and $40 per 1 million output.[] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/qnvinzyihf7d8vqueadc3yo5) - **o4-mini-deep-research (06-25)**: based on the o4-mini model, offering faster and more economical options for delayed and sensitive applications.[x] (https://assets-v2.circle.s/qnvinyyyithihf7d8vqueadc.so/70w78yvlövläl39ggu)

# **Web search enhanced:**

- o3, o3-pro and o4-mini have now supported web searches, allowing them to perform web searches in the course of the thinking chain.

- ** Pricing**: For o3, o4-mini and its in-depth research version, page search tool calls cost $10 per 1,000 calls

- Web search prices for the 4o and 4.1 models have been reduced to $25 per 1,000 and search content totoken at model rates (US$ 10 per 1,000 calls) plus currency input rates for the o3 and o4-mini models.

- This makes the costs more manageable for developers when using web search features and is appropriate for building applications that require real-time access to information.

# Asynchronous events support Webhooks OpenAI API now supports asynchronous events through Webhooks. This means that you can receive real-time notifications when the following events occur:

- Batch work done.

- Backstage response generation.

- Fine-tuning done.

By setting up Webhook, your system can be informed as soon as an incident occurs, without the need for continuous rounding of API, thereby increasing efficiency.

# ** Campaign announcement:** OpenAI DevDay 2025, scheduled to take place in San Francisco on 6 October 2025. The event is considered to be the largest so far and is expected to involve more than 1,500 developers. The event will include live presentations on the opening theme, hands-on construction sessions with the latest models and tools, multistage presentations and more presentations.[3] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/1e71n5fut684tx0a0hu1oe719cln): https://www.devday.openai.com/)
