OpenAI API Supported for adoption now Webhooks We're going to do an asymptomatic process.I don't know.
This means you can receive a real-time notification when the following events occur:

- Batch task complete.

- Backstage response generation

- Fine-tuning job complete.

By Settings Webhook Your system can be informed as soon as the incident occurs. There's no need for a continuous round of questioning. API And that's what makes it more efficient.I don't know.
