Genspark introduces a completely new tool for “AI Sheets”** spreadsheets**, combining large language models and AI tools to allow users to process data like a dialogue. The complete process of data search, collation, tabulation, analysis, and visualization can be accomplished automatically through a simple natural language directive.

- ** Personal Data Analyst**: Automatic analysis and visualization of data based on user input.

- ** Automatic data collection**: Automatic search of companies, people, products, etc. without manual search or input.

- ** AI Alternative formula**: batch data processing using AI, image/video generator and AI proxy to break the traditional Excel limit.

# Five core competencies:

#1 Generates complete spreadsheets in natural languages ** A single command is required to create a complete table of data**. For example, "I want a list of the top 100 AI start-ups in Singapore, including profiles, collection estimates, financing and a network of officials."

AI will search and generate a complete table of filled data without you moving a line code or a formula.

##2 Automatic data collection and organization no longer need to be copied from various pages. System auto:

- On-line search for high-quality information

- Clear redundancies and align formats

- Keeping the data source to trace it is like "data reptiles + assistant + cleaning specialists" with a full-time job.

##3 Replace the formula with AI to achieve automatic operation Genspark no longer relies on traditional functions like =SUM() or =VLOOKUP(), but instead with AI to achieve stronger automation:

- Bulk generation of personalized mail

- Batch Analysis YouTube Videos or Comments

- Text-to-language, large-scale image generation

- Cross-document extraction and cataloguing

AI Allows spreadsheets to become "** data automatic processing engines** " , which is not a simple computational tool.

##4 Everything Transfer Table: Document Smart Conversion Supported Imports include:

- PDF.

- Word Document

- Picture (OCR recognition form)

- Old Excel then converts the key to " Smart AI Tables " to continue analysis, question-and-answer, visualization.

##5 Smart analysis and visualization (separation complex functions) no longer need to write = IF(), = MATCH(). You can ask directly in language:

- “What is the growth trend in this data?”

- "Please compare the sales of these two brands."

AI will explain the results in graph + language, just like you're talking to a **data analyst**.

#  Example of practical application (click to view):

-  Automatic collection of data on American medical start-up companies -  Search for a list of family SUVs under $40,000![] (https://assets-v2.Circle.so/7w3a7z6jjgvgyramdx4biir5deb1f) - Analysis of marketing performance and visualization of results -  Bulk generation of promotional posters for Stanley Cups

#  For who? [https://assets-v2.Circle. so/429lh0u3d1rvn77f3iyef1lp5pyj] # # concluding the sentence: **Genspark AI Sheets turned the spreadsheet into a "talking autoanalyst" to help you break the manual search, paste and formulae, and complete the entire data task from the beginning of a sentence**
