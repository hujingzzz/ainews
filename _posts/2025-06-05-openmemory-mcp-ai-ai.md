**OpenMemory MCP** is a locally run application for the storage, organization and management of your "rememory" to carry context between different AI tools. It proposes solutions to three of the main difficulties of the current LLM tool, "Remembrance Inconsistence", "Deficiencies in context", "Inability of privacy":

- To provide a unified, structured and privately owned “memory layer”

- Localization of memory management, privacy security

- User-led data flow through permission models

- Support extension for multi-category AI client ecology

It is understood that:** for the first time, your AI personal assistant has a truly “you” permanent memory module that can be called back and forth between various AIs,** ensuring privacy and control in the hands of users**.

#  Core feature bright spot! [] (https://assets-v2.Circle.so/ c2kddhw25aoawk35g2ztlbe6m3) ## Typical use (Use Case) ** Project context transfer**

- You still have access to design details, constraints and requirements when you discuss an API design in Claude and move to Cursor code.

** Debug track records**

- MCP automatically records how you've checked certain types of bugs in the past, and AI can make proposals on the basis of these models.

**Prompt Historical Memory**

- Storage of your alert style in different tasks so that different tools can imitate or continue the style.

** Highlights and memories of the session**

- Recording the summaries of past meetings and your feedback, which AI can quote when generating a document or summing up.

** Log of product evolution**

- Recording the entire process of achieving the feedback from functional requirements, AI supporting retrospective and iterative.

## System architecture and security model  Local priority (Local-First):

- All data are only available locally by default and can be operated without network connections;

- Do not automatically synchronize to cloud ends unless the user does export or share operations on its own.[] (https://assets-v2.Circle.so/zb6tbl7mw5it1fpvr6whl4cxz4y)  Auditable (Permission-Base Access):

- Each AI tool reading/writing memory requires explicit authorization;

- Users can view detailed access logs and data uses.
