OpenAI announced the introduction of two core functions, enabling enterprise users to integrate in-house knowledge with ChatGPT depth: **Connectors (Connectors)**: Connecting enterprise internal knowledge sources (e.g. GitHub, Dropbox, SharePoint, etc.) to ChatGPT for intelligent retrieval and analysis of private domain knowledge. **Record Mode (record mode)**: Automatic recording, transcription, summary of meeting content, turning oral communication into searchable structured knowledge.** Through an entirely new ** Connector system, users have access to key tools such as Outlook, Google Drive, Gmail, etc., and to real-time background information within the limits of their competence. ** Supports access to SharePoint, Dropbox, Box, etc., to services such as softwares-v2.circle.so/9efqq4väkj6kj.

- All connectors** follow existing user privileges** and do not overstep access data.

- The new functionality is opened in stages, with different privileges and applications for users.

- Most connectors are mainly used for depth research functions.[] (https://assets-v2.circle.so/mcjr3gqoo5l7z9kq73byte6l2ytp)

- **Target**: To enable ChatGPT not only to search for web-based public content, but also to access in-house tools such as CRM, minutes of meetings, internal documents, etc.

- ** Features**: Succession of powers: access only to the content authorized by the user itself.

- Cross-platform support: support for Outlook, SharePoint, Teams, Dropbox, Google Drive, Box (Beta), etc.

- Efficient intelligent retrieval: achieving complex cross-system semantic search and multi-source cross-references.

** Presentation case: AGI Corp**

- Target: Q3 product planning for "Anmal GPT" (an animal voice translation model).

- Operating processes: access to the WebSpot, Outlook, Teams, etc. through the Deep Research portal.

Question: “What potential distribution partners in Q3 are most in line with corporate strategies?”

- Deep Research automatically analyses the likelihood of dealing with potential transactions, projected revenues, related discussions, etc., and generates matrices with original references.

# #

- ** Query product strategy and collection data**: “ChhatGPT, tell me about Q2 market and product strategy, and which functions lead to maximum harvest?”

- **Automated identification of data sources**, e.g., searching for a user-active trend map of “Bark to Text V2”, ChhatGPT automatically calls existing enterprise data generation to visualize.

- **Aggregation user feedback**: Quickly locate and summarize Dropbox interviews with pet owners, refine pain points and ROI ranking recommendations, and generate Q3 product documents that match the internal template.

#  **The introduction of the Record Mode on-line** has also allowed ChatGPT to become an intelligent recorder in the meeting scene, automatically organizing information from the recording and generating a follow-up task or code, further broadening its usefulness in the work scene.

- Recording meetings, brainstorms or voice notes

- ChatGPT will do the following thing automatically:

- extraction of key points

- Automatically generate follow-up items, plans or codes

Currently only Team users on MacOS ** are about to be extended to **: Plus, Pro, Enterprise, Edu users![] (https://assets-v2.Circle. so/1hppttekok0qfdmq0vu554mwd) ## core function

- **Auto-reproduced + Structured Summary**: Recording the proceedings, generating summary of points, action items, and marking of speaking times.

- May jump to the corresponding audio segment to facilitate review and recitation.

** Knowledge integration search**:

- Users can ask directly: "What are the technical constraints mentioned at the last Q3 planning meeting? "

- ChatGPT automatically retrieves voice summaries and text information and highlights the source.

** Conference content translated into outputs**:

- Automatically generate updated management reports, planning documents, etc.

♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ apply the scene ♪

- Reducing the burden of manual notes;

- There is no need to repeat questions or recall the contents after the meeting;

- More efficient reuse of knowledge and decision-making in voice conferences.

# ** Supports the MPCP function** In addition, through Model Context Protocol (MCP), the administrator can integrate ChatGPT with a custom-defined system to create an AI-assisted workflow suitable for the enterprise. Support the linking of ChatGPT to the enterprise internal system (pro, Team, Enterprise and Edu administrator configurations only). This allows ChatGPT not only to search information, but also to think and act in conjunction with enterprise data.

- The function is in the beta test stage.

- **MCP** Allows managers to integrate enterprise internal systems, proprietary tools or applications into ChatGPT.

- Allows integration of own data with web search, official connector to AI achieve: data retrieval

- It's in context.

- Automatic decision-making and action

Applied users: **Pro Users, Team, Enterprise, Edu Administrator**
