- **Generate video from static images**Generate video from static images-Users can upload their own maps or use them Midjourney Images generated One key generates four. 5 Snippets 

- **Extendable to 20‚Äì21 sec**Extendable to 20‚Äì21 sec-Initial 5 Second You can add up to four times per video 4 sec Up to the limit. 20or 21I'm not sure what I'm talking about.sec 

- **Animation Control**Animation Control-Two types of support. motion Mode-
Low move.Low Motion:Fits for fine kinetic effects in static settings 

- A high sense of motion.High Motion:For larger cameras or character movements I don't know.

- Select to automatically animate the image or adjust the dynamic effects through texttips I don't know.

MidjourneyOrganisation Other AI The goal of the video model is much more than just a Hollywood movie. B-roll Material or commercial advertising for the advertising industryI don't know.Midjourney Chief Executive Officer David Holz Name The... AI Video models are the next step in the company's move towards the ultimate goal. Create‚ÄúAt the end of the day,It's a real-time open world simulation.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.It's... it's... it's... AI ModelI don't know.
 Midjourney The long-term goal is to build one.**A real-time open world simulation system**A real-time open world simulation system-

Veo 3 More price advantage.I don't know.

**Quality & Style**Quality & Style-

- The video has been inherited. Midjourney High quality and art style in image generation Every frame has a beauty similar to a painting. It's like the director's teaching the dynamic.I don't know.

- Emphasizing**High-level visual effects**High-level visual effects But the current video resolution and details are likely to compete with the top rivals.Like Luma Labs It's... it's... it's...

## Limitations
**No Audio Generation**No Audio Generation-

- and Google Veo 3 or Luma Labs It's... it's... it's... Dream Machine Different Midjourney Video models do not support the generation of audio orbits or environmental soundings for the time being User needs to manually add tracks at a later stageI don't know.

**Length and Edit Limits**Length and Edit Limits-

- Video duration limit to:20sec And don't support time-axis editingScene transition or continuity across segments The function is lower.I don't know.

**Generate Speed**Generate Speed-

- Rendering time may be slower. Compared to some competitors,Like MiniMax It's... it's... it's... Hailuo 02This is the first time I've ever seen you.Less efficient in handling complex sports or cinematography.I don't know.

## Comparison with competitors
Midjourney There's been a very competitive entry. AI Video Generation Market Face RunwayLuma LabsGoogle Veo 3MiniMax Hailuo 02 Waiting for the challenge of the opponent.-

- **Advantages**Advantages-Midjourney Depending on their mature image-generation techniques and user-friendly interfaces Provide seamless graphics to video workflows Lower cost Fits for short video experiments and creative explorationI don't know.

- **Weaknesses**Weaknesses-Lack of audio generationShorter video durations and limited editing functions make it less comprehensive than Runway or Luma Labs ProductsI don't know.

## How to Generate Video
1. UseMidjourneyImages generated

- After opening the image in the library Click **‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Animate ImageIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.**‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Animate ImageIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea. Button is fine.-
**Auto**Auto-Automatically generate video using the original diagram;

- **Manual**Manual-Allows the editing of hint words before generation;

The original parameter used to generate the image is automatically removed Does not affect video generation;
Mouse Suspended‚ÄúAt the end of the day,CreateIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.A shortcut entry button is also shown on the image on the pageI don't know.
2. Use user upload images

- Pass. **‚ÄúAt the end of the day,ImagineIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Enter an icon for the picture in the bar**‚ÄúAt the end of the day,ImagineIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Enter an icon for the picture in the bar Upload Images or Select Existing Images;

- Drag Image to‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Starting FrameIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Regional It can be used as a starting frame.;

- Lock images to repeat multiple hint words;

- Only use images as images‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Start FrameIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Method of use Other citations such as:‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Style Reference@Ambassin: #Jan25 pic.twitter.com/m3Image PromptIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Waiting for video generation not supportedI don't know.

### üìê Output Resolution & Video Dimensions
The resulting video resolution is fixed as **480pStandard ClearnessI'm not sure what I'm talking about.**480pStandard ClearnessI'm not sure what I'm talking about. The actual size is influenced by the width ratio of the initial image-

- --motion high-Large Camera MovesVisible Role ActionsMay cause unnatural or unreality.);

- --raw-Turn off system style optimization Respond more accurately to Hint ControlI don't know.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Use uploading requirementsComplianceI'm not sure what I'm talking about.

- Uploading images requires legal access;

- It's forbidden to create insults.Pornification or seditious video Especially when it comes to real people.;

- The system automatically filters the content of the violation. **The intercepted video won't be deducted.GPUTime**The intercepted video won't be deducted.GPUTime;

- If you do not agree to the provision It is recommended that external images not be used to generate videosI don't know.
