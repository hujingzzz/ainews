**AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer)** was developed as a research-level medical dialogue by Google AI earlier published in Nature, focused text-based diagnostics.** This upgrade was ** multi-module AMIE** with the ability to understand, request and reasoned visual medical information.** There were significant upgrades in this case?** Multi-model capabilities**: previously only text-based dialogue could now be supported with visual information such as pictures, reports, etc.. (e.g. skin photographs, laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, etc.)** Thinking like doctors** ** Construction of a doctor's dialogue process, ** Support for the state-of-the-ground reasoning reasoning of the doctor's dialogue laboratory.** It will automatically ask or request relevant images, such as “pleases with skin pictures of the disease.”** The dialogue is more like an interactive image (e.g. m.d. /m. /m. /m. /m. /m. /m. /m. — m. — m. — m. — — m. — m. — m. — m. — m. — m. — m. — m. — m. — m. — m. — m. — m. — m. — m. — m. — m. — m. — m. — m. — m. — — — m. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —

- The system chats with virtual “patients”, who provide pictures and symptoms.

- Simulation of dialogue in real medical examinations (similar to the “standardized patient” scene at the doctor's internship).

- An expert doctor evaluates AI's performance, for example: is it in place? Is the diagnosis accurate?

To efficiently validate the quality of the system, Google constructed ** a complete dialogue simulation assessment framework**:

- More accurate diagnosis.

- I'm better at analyzing pictures.

- The diagnosis is more complete.

- It's better to communicate with one another. It's clearer.

Moreover, in its understanding of the picture,** there were few instances of “speeching” or misreading**.

# # Human Doctor Comparison Experiment (virtual OSCE evaluation) Using Medical Education Standard Measurement: ** Simulation of Structured Clinical Examination OSCE**. ** Experimental Design: **

- For comparison: AMIE vs. Primary Health Care Doctors (PCPs)

- Simulation cases: 105

- Patients ' roleplayers can upload multi-model data (e.g. skin maps)

- Blind scoring by dermatology/hearts/minors

- These results are currently only being tested in the simulated environment and need to be further tested in real hospitals.

- The future will allow it to support voice, video, and not just typing.

- Worked with Beth Israel Hospital in Boston to prepare a real clinical trial.
