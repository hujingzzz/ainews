AMIEThe multi-module capacity is achieved through the use of diversified medical data.Include ImagesIt's like a dermatology photo..Time series dataIt's like an electrocardiogram.I'm not sure what I'm talking about.and table dataLike laboratory resultsI don't know what to say.Yeah.Gemini 2.0 FlashIt's fine-tuned and developed.I don't know.That's...AMIECan handle extensive clinical input Making it a more common tool in diagnostic dialogueI don't know.

## How does it train and test?
Google I built a simulated medical environment.-

- System & Virtual‚ÄúAt the end of the day,PatientsIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Chat Patients provide pictures and symptoms.I don't know.

- It simulated a conversation in a real medical exam.It's kind of like a doctor's internship.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Standardized patientsIt's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.SceneI'm sorry, I don't know.

- Expert medical assessment AI Performance Like what?-Ask if it's in place.Accurate diagnosisAre you kidding me?

In order to efficiently validate the quality of the system, Google It's built.**Complete Dialogue Simulation Assessment Framework**Complete Dialogue Simulation Assessment Framework-

## What about the test results?
Very good.AMIE In many ways, it's even more than a real junior doctor.-

- A more accurate diagnosis of the condition.

- I'm better at analyzing pictures.

- The diagnosis is more complete.

- It's better to communicate with one another.Make it clearer.

And it's about understanding the picture. **I hardly showed up.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Nonsense.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Or misread it.**I hardly showed up.‚ÄúAt the end of the day,Nonsense.It's not a good idea, it's not a good idea.Or misread it.I don't know.

- By dermatology./Cardiac./We're going to get blind marks from a specialist in medicine.

Google Organisation-

- So far, these results are just simulations of the environment. Need to be tested further in a real hospital.I don't know.

- The future will allow it to support the voice.Video consultation It's not just typing.I don't know.

- It's already with Boston. Beth Israel Hospitals work together to prepare real clinical trials.I don't know.
