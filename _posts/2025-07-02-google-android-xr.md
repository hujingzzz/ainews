Google displayed the prototype Android XR smart glasses at the Google I/O 2025 Congress, and announced the integration of its advanced Gemini AI model deep into a brand-new Android XR platform, making it the first “**Android platform for the Gemini era**.” **Target** provides natural, immature, real-time artificial intelligence experience through headwear (e.g., smart glasses, AR/VR head displays, etc.) to enable an AI assistant to “see what you see”, understand the scene and provide instant help.

- **The context understands:** The user perspective is captured through cameras and microphones, and the current scene and tasks are understood in the context of geographic information.

- ** Voice interaction:** Voice helpers are activated at any time, no need to wake up manually, no need to use a mobile phone.

- ** Real-time aids: ** Automatically recommended actions based on user behaviour, such as navigation, data checking, photographing, translation, etc.

- **Memory and personalization:** long-term mission memory function, understanding user preferences, context.

- Integration with Gemini, real visual assistant.

Google showed a realistic use of the **Android XR device at the I/O Congress**, covering the following capabilities: [https://assets-v2.circle.so/6rfq2nt67ub4pa4se5bf6z4c2nc6] Real-time translation map navigation, real-time access to information and responses, photographs and videos, marking Google’s movement towards an integrated platform for the “AI+ Hardware Plus Operating System.”  Gemini will become the intelligent layer of the real world and no longer confined to the screen.

-  ** Camera**: for visual recognition, AR scene capture;

- **Microphone**: receiving voice commands and using them for environmental sound processing;

-  speaker**: provision of voice feedback, navigation aircasts, etc.;

-  Display of information in the lens** (optional): private projection information on the lens, not hologram/AR display, but with basic alarm and subtitle functions;

-  ** Working with mobile phones**: The glasses themselves are not stand-alone equipment, and data processing and display are separated by pairing Bluetooth/Wi-Fi with Android mobile phones.

To ensure that glasses are fashionable and wearable, Google is collaborating with several brands:[][] (https://assets-v2.Circle.so/9wj1custf3udt3dge3dge3173an459m)
