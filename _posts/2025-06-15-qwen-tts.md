The core ability of the Ali Clouds to publish**Qwen-TTS** high-performance speech synthesis models (Text-to-Speech, TTS). The core capability is to convert inputed Chinese and English text into a voice output with natural expression power. The greatest bright spot for Qwen-TTS compared to the traditional TTS models is:

- ** High Nature**: Voice expression is closer to the person, with emotion, rhythm, tone change;

- ** Multilingual and dialectic support**: currently in favour of Mandarin, English and three Chinese dialects (Beijing, Shanghai, Sichuan);

- ** Multisound selection**: Provides different genders, tone and accents, adapted to diverse scenes.

## Language and dialect support details Supported speech variants: <[] (https://assets-v2.Circle.so/v74xkerya07wp 34scg5vv90zg) Real synthesis sample: **https://qwenlm.github.io/zh/blog/qwen-ttts/**

## Technical principles and data base 1. Large-scale training for language support Model training uses **3 million hours** of voice data, including Chinese-English alignment data and a wealth of dialectic materials, which makes the model not only natural voice but also imitate the style of speech in different regions. 2. Rhythm and emotional modelling Qwen-TTS Support** Automatically adjust the speed, accent, rhythm and emotional performance of text**. For example, when expressing surprise, tenderness or anger, voice automatically reflects the corresponding emotion without the need for a visible sign. 3. Sound modelling and style migration.

- The model allows the same sentence to produce a voice output in a variety of styles (e.g. male/female, Northern/South).

- Current support **7 sounds**: Cherry, Ethan, Chelsie, Serena (Chinese and English)

- Dylan, Jada, Sunny.

## Performance assessment: [] [https://assets-v2.circle.so/r1q7s630kkk5h6p1u7n2cecv4faf3] model on **SeedTS-Eval** core indicators:

- **WER (word error rate): ** The accuracy of speech recognition reverse text should be as low as possible;

- **SIM (symmetry of sound)** measures the degree of proximity between the generation and the target sound, as high as possible.

### 如何使用：API 与代码接入方式
**价格：**
![](https://assets-v2.circle.so/lqxd9zgzsxkmqxw1db1vffmssr0n)Qwen-TTS 通过 Qwen API 的方式提供，用户可通过如下 Python 示例调用模型完成语音合成任务：
基本流程：
设定 API 密钥（DashScope API）；
设定合成语句、目标音色和模型版本；
调用合成函数，获取音频链接；
下载并保存音频文件。
示例代码片段（简化）：
import os
import requests
import dashscope
def get_api_key():
api_key = os.getenv("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
raise EnvironmentError("DASHSCOPE_API_KEY environment variable not set.")
return api_key
def synthesize_speech(text, voice="Dylan", model="qwen-tts-latest"):
api_key = get_api_key()
try:
response = dashscope.audio.qwen_tts.SpeechSynthesizer.call(
model=model,
api_key=api_key,
text=text,
voice=voice,
)
# Check if response is None
if response is None:
raise RuntimeError("API call returned None response")
# Check if response.output is None
if response.output is None:
raise RuntimeError("API call failed: response.output is None")
# Check if response.output.audio exists
if not hasattr(response.output, 'audio') or response.output.audio is None:
raise RuntimeError("API call failed: response.output.audio is None or missing")
audio_url = response.output.audio["url"]
return audio_url
except Exception as e:
raise RuntimeError(f"Speech synthesis failed: {e}")
def download_audio(audio_url, save_path):
try:
resp = requests.get(audio_url, timeout=10)
resp.raise_for_status()
with open(save_path, 'wb') as f:
f.write(resp.content)
print(f"Audio file saved to: {save_path}")
except Exception as e:
raise RuntimeError(f"Download failed: {e}")
def main():
text = (
"""哟，您猜怎么着？今儿个我看NBA，库里投篮跟闹着玩似的，张手就来，篮筐都得喊他“亲爹”了"""
)
save_path = "downloaded_audio.wav"
try:
audio_url = synthesize_speech(text)
download_audio(audio_url, save_path)
except Exception as e:
print(e)
if __name__ == "__main__":
main()
